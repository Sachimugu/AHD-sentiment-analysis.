Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on 5mg Lisinopril (the little pink pills manufactured by Lupin Pharm) for 5 or more years. My BP was well managed, then Walgreens changed the manufacturer/supplier of the 5mg pills to Solco Healthcare--a Zhejiang Huahai (China) Pharma company. I immediately saw a rise in my bp which culminated with a trip to the ER with 191/119 bp...no other changes in my life. Zhejiang has a history of using unacceptable 'binding' materials  in their pills. I'm on a quest to find out if Walgreens has some business connection with Solco. These are unacceptable.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After trying “norvasc” and having bad side effects, Dr put me on Lisinopril 10mg. Knowing that I am sensitive to medications, I cut the pill in half so I have been taking 5mg. My blood pressure is down to 105/65 and I feel great!! I guess I did not realize how bad I felt with high BP, until I treated it and can look back and say ‘wow’. It was affecting me greatly. It took about 3 days for the lisinopril to build up and start working, I check my BP twice daily. It was dropping slowly every day, but the third day was the day it finally came down to 105/65. Anyways, I have had absolutely zero side effects on Lisinopril. I read all these bad reviews and I know everyone responds differently, but this one is a winner for me. On top of it all, my insurance copay was $1.60. lol. No complaints here. Thought I would share a GOOD experience, seeing people usually come here only when they have a bad one.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Prescribed isinopril for borderline High Blood Pressure 10mg. Initially left me feeling very weak and extremely lethargic and sleepy/tired.  Back to doc for follow up, they advise this was my body adjusting and getting used to blood pressure being in a normal range. Blood pressure better, but wow the side effects were not good at all.  Side effects were heart palpitations, extreme fatigue, generally feeling of being unwell and sick. Flu like symptoms and over production of phlegm, numbness and tingling in hands and feet. Discharge in my eyes and lessened my quality of life. At 25 day mark I decided to try cutting pills in half, to wean myself off.  The first day off I was already starting to feel better. After coming off, some days I've felt decent, but still struggle with the withdrawal side effects.  The cough, and nausea.  I've changed my diet for the better and only drink water. Glad to find message boards to share this info to let others they are not alone.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Lowering your blood pressure is incredibly important but the side effects make you feel so awful on this stuff.

It causes an allergic type reaction. I constantly have a postnasal drip, dry cough, lungs feel bad. I feel exhausted and sick on this stuff. And it is a very repeatable test.

Also, it depletes your zinc. Which allows strep bacteria to grow, holes in your gut, among tons of problems. 

Telmistartan makes me feel fantastic. Never again Lisinoprol. I feel like I've lost 3 weeks of my life in a lousy feeling haze. So annoyed it takes me this long to figure it out.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started Lisinopril in February, so about 10 months ago. 20mg per day, one per day when I woke up for high BP. Exactly three months to the day of when I took the first one I woke up from a nap incredibly dizzy. I had just refilled my meds the day before so I started the new bottle that morning. Same manufacturer. I was so dizzy I felt like the room was spinning and laying down made it worse. I waited until it passed two days later and made an appointment with my PCP. After CT, MRI, blood work, EKG, topamax, meloxicam, a muscle relaxer, two different types of vertigo diagnosis, I came upon this forum. My symptoms were dizziness, neck and back tension, blood pressure dropping when standing, tingling in my face and arms, anxiety and fatigue. All of this since May. I stopped Lisinopril three days ago. I’m already feeling somewhat better. I just hope I’m back to myself once it’s all out of my system. I don’t recommend it.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on this lisinopril  medication about a month and a half and it has helped my blood pressure so much. At my last doctors appointment it was 117/78. It has never been that low. However, as soon as I started the medicine I had a horrible cough. I went and got tested for covid, I’ve been on antibiotics and had chest X-rays because the urgent thought I had some kind of virus. I finally went into my primary care and right away they knew it was the Lisinopril. I would have never put the 2 together. Although it has helped my blood pressure there is no way I can cough like this on a daily basis. It has really affected my life. I have had a hard time taking care of my kids and I’m so exhausted from coughing and not sleeping.”","

Chlorthalidone for 5 months and apart from a mild dry cough I was okay but felt some weight gain might be a result despite being diuretic.

Doc puts me on linospril. Within days I had a worse cough, joints have started aching, back and hips hurt for no reason, and even worse, I’ve had allergic reactions three times in a month where my eyes and cheeks swell up and hurt and burn (angiodema). I couldn’t figure out what was causing these weird flares but each time I took Benadryl and it would subside in a day or two. I started researching causes of “rapid, itching, burning face and eye swelling” and ACE inhibitors like Linospril were some of the first results that popped up. One study said up to 30% of patients taking it have had reactions!

I know others they have no issue. But the high rate of anaphylaxis and allergic reaction should be carefully considered by all as apparently it can develop at any time, days, months or years in.....”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“It works great for lowering blood pressure and generally made me feel better. For about three weeks. Then the side effects kicked in.

I also had blurred vision, cramps in my feet and hands and some headaches too, but after including an hour of combined aerobics and stretching exercises 3-4 days per week most of the symptoms are now reduced to the occasional headaches. Taking the pill with plenty of water and with food also reduced the blurred vision.  In a year I have lost about 35lbs. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels are normal and my doctor has recently lowered my dosage from 10 to 5mg. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been taking Lisinopril for 4 years. I did have a slight dry cough when I started, but it's mostly gone. However, two years ago I developed a pain in my abdomen on the left side about 10th rib. It would come and go, but it was always there. It's been more less constant for two years. And for two years my doctor's have ignored my please for help, and one nurse practitioner said, ""what do you want me to do about it"". I finally read about angioedema of the small bowl causing pain. So I stopped taking the Lisinopril and the pain immediately went away after 3 days. While on Lisinopril and amlodipine I  never got my BP below 
130/80 consistently. So I wonder if they are really worth it? Living in constant pain. I also blame the fact that I'm on Medicaid and believe I get sub par health Care. My doctor never questioned the possibility that my pain was from the meds. His standard line was the pain you have is worth the risk. I don't think so.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on 5 mg of Lisinopril for over 2 years.  I never developed the cough or nasal drip that others have had.  I did have joint pain which would come and go.  Lisinopril is great at controlling my BP.  I'm an otherwise-healthy 5'3"" 125 pound 47 yo female and my BP diastolic would not stay below 90.  Typical BP was 140/98.  So, I've taken 5 mg of Lisinopril for 2 years.  But, I'm exhausted ALL the time, no appetite, severe abdominal pain, constant nausea and bloating/constipation when I do eat.  I'm miserable (has been like this for 6 mo)!! On a whim, I stopped the Lisinopril 3 days ago.  I'm not exhausted anymore.  My appetite is back. Still have pain and nausea though.”","

I started having heart palpitations, extreme dizziness, I lost close to 30 lbs, hair lose, swollen nose, lip, and eye, pains/pressure in the top and back of head, shortness of breathe, blurred vision, weakness, nausea, pains in my stomach, night sweats, and leg cramps, entire body felt shaky ( and I'm pretty sure I'm missing some things).

Taking the pill with plenty of water and with food also reduced the blurred vision.  In a year I have lost about 35lbs. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels are normal and my doctor has recently lowered my dosage from 10 to 5mg. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been taking Lisinopril for 4 years. I did have a slight dry cough when I started, but it's mostly gone. However, two years ago I developed a pain in my abdomen on the left side about 10th rib. It would come and go, but it was always there. It's been more less constant for two years. And for two years my doctor's have ignored my please for help, and one nurse practitioner said, ""what do you want me to do about it"". I finally read about angioedema of the small bowl causing pain. So I stopped taking the Lisinopril and the pain immediately went away after 3 days. While on Lisinopril and amlodipine I  never got my BP below 
130/80 consistently. So I wonder if they are really worth it? Living in constant pain. I also blame the fact that I'm on Medicaid and believe I get sub par health Care. My doctor never questioned the possibility that my pain was from the meds. His standard line was the pain you have is worth the risk. I don't think so.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on 5 mg of Lisinopril for over 2 years.  I never developed the cough or nasal drip that others have had.  I did have joint pain which would come and go.  Lisinopril is great at controlling my BP.  I'm an otherwise-healthy 5'3"" 125 pound 47 yo female and my BP diastolic would not stay below 90.  Typical BP was 140/98.  So, I've taken 5 mg of Lisinopril for 2 years.  But, I'm exhausted ALL the time, no appetite, severe abdominal pain, constant nausea and bloating/constipation when I do eat.  I'm miserable (has been like this for 6 mo)!! On a whim, I stopped the Lisinopril 3 days ago.  I'm not exhausted anymore.  My appetite is back. Still have pain and nausea though.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Doc put me on 10mg.  I developed what seemed like sciatic nerve pain.  Every morning when getting out of bed for the day I had pain in my left buttocks, thigh, down my calf & tingling into my foot.  After being up for an hour or so, the pain subsided & I could pretty much do what I wanted.  I also noticed I was easily fatigued & felt somewhat depressed.  Doc increased the dose to 20mg daily after 6 months.  Then the sciatic pain in the morning increased to nearly unbearable. I had no energy.  I was ready to see an Orthopedic Dr when I checked on line for severe side effects of Lisinopril.  I was stunned - joint, nerve & sciatic pain.  Hair loss, weight gain, depression, cough, fatigue & etc.  I stopped the med. & now feeling great.”","

I was told they changed the place where the pharmacy got the meds which probably meant was a different formula because the pills look different. I requested name brand Zestril even though they were more expensive. I felt 100% better! No more generic for me!”,1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My blood pressure was 150's/100's. My doctor did not want to prescribe Altace which worked in the past. The prescription he gave me was 20mg Lisinopril with 12.5mg of hydrochlorothiazide. My blood pressure has reduced to 120's/80's. My blood pressure does fluctuate sometimes to 90/70. I then become very dizzy. I have been experiencing extreme muscle fatigue especially in my shoulders, neck, arms and jaw muscles along with the tongue. When eating my jaws become quite cramped. My heart rate jumps up to about 130 at times. I find myself needing to take large breaths at times. Any physical exertion brings dizziness and fatigue within an hour or so. ”","

Also developed tingly sensation in my forearms, hands and feet. Experienced numbness in my fingers and pain in my wrists. Felt as if I drank a bunch of caffeine -- heart was racing and felt very nervous. Called my doctor who said he didn't think it was the lisinopril but I told him it was the only new thing happening. I've just stopped . Pharmacist said it will take 48 hours for the two pills to be out of my system. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This medicine was horrible.  It immediately gave me neck, back and shoulder tightness and discomfort.  I couldn't breathe fully on it, so I was unable to exercise like normal.  And worse, it did not lower my BP.  In fact, it seemed to have the reverse affect.  I got off this in a week.  I hear others do well on this drug, but it surely did not work for me.”","

Paramedics think I ""bottomed out"" and to tell my doctor and he'll probably change it from 10mg. It was scary, thought I saw the ""white light"", I'm losing weight too, maybe too fast. Anyway I'm hoping he'll let me not take them at all and just let me try with my lifestyle changes.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking 10 mg lisinopril for BP for a few months after trying a few others which gave me terrible back pain. My back pain  on lisinopril is  bearable, but the dry cough and runny nose have become intolerable. 3 days ago, I started taking 3 teaspoons of organic Apple cider vinegar (with the Mother included) with lukewarm water in the morning, and it seems to eliminate a lot of the phlegm in my lungs, thus less coughing and hacking. If this keeps on working, will continue with lisinopril, otherwise I will have to try some other medication. It's the nitric oxide produced by this pill that irritates the lungs, apparently. I wish the pharmaceutical companies would take this into consideration.”","

I have fibromyalgia and have muscle aches and pains and attributed the muscles aches to that. I missed 2 days of the med and felt pretty good - blood pressure was fine. I know meds stay in our bodies for a few days, so I wasn't concerned. I took the med the next day and realized the awful muscle pain was back.   I tried this 2 more times to make sure it wasn't a coincidence.  The Lisinopril is causing the extreme muscle aches. No more Lisinopril for me!”","

I had severe leg cramping at night, my skin seems to show every vein due to lisiniprol sucking the life out of me. I work all day, I couldn't wait to get into my bed at the end of the day I was totally exhausted. I would wake up in the middle of the night with a dry cough limiting my sleep and feeling like I did not sleep at all. This is not living life as it was meant to be.

Blood pressure (BP) has gone from 180/95 to 118/78 and body weight has gone from 200lbs to 170lbs. I was surprised that taking this medication and losing 30lbs after 13 months was enough to bring my BP to normal.  At first I had muscle cramps in legs, feet and hands, but after adding 45 minutes of walking and 15 minutes of stretching 4 days a week, most of the problems are at a tolerable level, and I feel much more energetic too.  During the rainy season, I check out exercise DVD's for 'Baby Boomers' from the library to keep up my exercise regimen. Doctor says if I lose another 20lbs he can lower the dosage which is incentive enough for me to add a modest diet to my regimen. I haven't felt this good in years.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“Been on lisinopril for 5 years. My 10mg dose caused dry cough and numbness of fingers for a while then I started having heart bounding mid morning and feeling of exhaustion after a meal. I started 10mg morning and 10mg at night and that seemed to have worked with side effects less severe. My doctor refused to give me 10mg twice a day and insisted on 20mg once a day. I still don't agree with him since it was working for me so I followed his prescription. BP still high. They say half life of medication is 12 hours but it doesn't seem like it because at end of 24 hrs my BP is high. Another thing I noticed is most of time when I get new refill the drug gives me trouble and BP is high. I think the different manufacturers produce a different drug. Some times it works and some times it don't. I get refills at Kaiser who import the drugs from different countries based on price as per the pharmacist at kaiser”,"

Two weeks later I had terrible upper GI/ esophageal pain that resolved when I stopped the medication. My doctor seemed a bit skeptical that the medication was causing GI symptoms, but given the documented reports of these side effects I stopped taking it and have not had a relapse of symptoms.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on several bp meds all giving me side effects. I was on lisinopril 10mg, but my bp was too high so they upped it to 20mg, but it's still high. I am having tons of side effects. Nonstop headaches, lightheaded, limb tingling, aching, swelling, left arm pain, feet pain, constant congestion, chest discomfort, back pain, anxieties. I need to get them to change it before I have a stroke or heart attack.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking Lisinopril 2 months ago. It did lower my BP but I had to stop immediately due to getting an eye condition called episcleritis. My eyes burned, itched, watered, and became severely red and I woke up with crusty eyes. The pain became too much to bear. I stopped the medication and they were all better in 2 days. This is a very rare side effect but I wanted to share my experience.”","

After reading the many horror stories, I was hesitant to start taking it and was going to consult the doctor about alternatives before trying. In lieu of talking with the doctor about alternatives, I decided to take a few days off and start the 10mg dosage to see how it would make me feel.  Day 1 and 2, I was a little foggy and had some fatigue but the BP results were seen within 1 hour of starting (120/70) and have been taking now for two weeks with no more side effects.  Beyond now taking the drug and a few lifestyle changes, I am very happy with the results. Working towards getting off this stuff within 6 months with weight loss and life changes. 51/male.”","

Repeated coughing spasms throughout the day, haven’t slept even remotely well in months. I stopped taking it 10 days ago because I couldn’t deal with the coughing and lack of sleep any more.

It wan’t until this past November after an exercise heart catherization  that the cardiologist determined my BP was 20 points higher inside my heart.  I was running 140/90 with an arm monitor.  My cardiologist prescribed lisinipril  5 mg.
I got a second opinion and this cardiologist increased the lisinipril to 10 mg and I was instructed to add 5 mg at night if my BP was over 140/90.  I immediately started a dry cough especially night, have had troubles keeping, stomach problems and very very sore joints.

Horrendous coughing episodes, nasty bitter taste in my mouth and ringing in the ears.  I connect all of these to this med because nothing else can be accountable since I started taking it along with the research I have done on it.  I told my doctor just 2 days ago that I will not take it any longer and she changed my BP meds to another brand.

As I started taking the reformulated pills, I noticed severe fatigue & falling asleep after every meal. Stared feeling depressed & finally severe heart pounding & arrhythmia within 1 hour after taking it. That scared me so I stopped. Within 3 days I was no longer fatigued, had a brighter outlook & NO heart arrhythmia or pounding. Whatever Lupin did in their reformulation it took a proper functioning medication & made it dangerous to use.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“Here's my experience with lisinopril. Took it for about a month and had a pain going from the side of my head down to my left finger tips. BP would be good sometimes but shoot up when I went to the doctor (possible white coat syndrome but it wouldn't go down much) and heart rate would be elevated 90's to low 100's resting. Switched to coreg 12.5 mg a day with lexapro 5 mg to lower anxiety. Pain went away and lowered heart rate but stopped the lexapro after third night because I felt hot and trouble sleeping but maybe should have stuck with it. Coreg would work somewhat but BP could go up if I felt the slightest bit anxious or angry. Dumped my doctor and switched to a new one. New doc prescribed 50 mg of metoprolol and back to the 5mg lexapro to help the shakes and anxiety. Start the metoprolol tomorrow and lexapro a couple days later so hopefully this works. Lisinopril may work for you but definitely not for me.”,"

Two months later my bp has only slightly been lower but at what cost. I'm now starting to feel nauseous & have lost my appetite for about two days now. The pains are still here with now pains starting to be pin pointed towards where my heart is. I don't know if I had a silent heart attack, if its a side effect of lisinopril or an acid reflux.

A look at a year of blood work showed a gradual decline in function. I was sent to a nephrologist, who looked very thoroughly at my meds and history. He told me it was probably the lisinipril. 
Tapering off of the med has caused almost constant premature atrial contractions, which are not life threatening, but sent me to the ER in day 10. 
Ten days off and my kidneys were already functioning better. It's really strange that this happened, given Lisinopril's use in kidney patients. I'm just glad that the problem was caught in time. Keep an eye on your creatinine and eGFR.”","

Gradually over past 7 months got weight down to 80kg. Diet, regular cardio (cross trainer) and anaerobic (weights). Stopped the diuretic. BP 130/80.
Initially side effects were persistent, dry coughing but that stopped when I quit smoking. Occasionally a little light-headed a few hours or so after taking. No other problems with lisinopril. 
The diuretic was a pain, getting up 2-4 times at night for a pee.

I did,  and wound up in an ER semi-conscious; BP systolic (top number) was 52, I forget diastolic probably because I want to!  Big worry was that my kidneys had ""taken a hit.""

Stopping the medication resulted in the return of my high BP, but all my symptoms went away after about 2 weeks.   Doctors never even connected the lisinopril with the symptoms.

Two weeks in, I experienced a sustained accelerated pulse rate and went into the doctor’s office. We decided the pulse rate could be due to an interaction between the Lisinopril and some decongestants I had been taking. I was prescribed antibiotics in case I had a sinus infection. Two weeks later, after reading reviews on line, that my symptoms might be a reaction to the Lisinopril. I stopped taking it and, within two days, felt much better.

Bp was all over the place, high, low, everywhere in between. After about 10 months on it, I realized that it must the reason I feel like crap. No energy, muscle aches, dizziness, weight gain of 10 lbs. even with working out and eating healthy. I feel like I've aged 20 years in the past 12 months. Every joint in my body ACHES, even the tips of my fingers and toes. Cut back to 2.5 mg and feel a little better. Looking for natural alternatives to this stuff.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Lisinopril  gave me a dreadful cough and breathing problems which I had never had in my life.  I also got a UTI and after anti biotics was left with severe lower abdominal pain and leaking a few times.  Research found this can be caused by ACE inhibitors  
ACE-Inhibitors and the Risk of Urinary Tract Infections
I stopped the tablets and leaks stopped immediately and others symptoms eventually went after a few weeks.  
Dr refused to acknowledge it was the medicine.  
Daughter had similar problems.  Dreadful medicine.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was put on 20mg of Lisinopril for HBP when I went to the ER and was diagnosed with bronchitis in mid January 2016. I attributed my feeling worse to the progression of the bronchitis instead of this drug. However, after months of not feeling any better I noticed that my hacking cough, endless postnasal drip, difficulty swallowing, general fatigue seemed to get so much worse shortly after taking this medication. It prompted me to research the side effects and read online hundreds of testimonials of people with similar symptoms to those I had who also saw a correlation between this medication and their symptoms. After my CT scans and blood work revealed I no longer had bronchitis, I knew that Lisinopril was to blame. I stopped taking it.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I wasn't told that Lisinipril would prevent migraines which I have been plagued with and paid out of pocket oh, so much money for prescriptions for many years. Within 5 days I wondered why I had not yet had a headache.  Each day, waiting, questioning, finally googled it. My suspicions were correct. I started Lisinipril 17 days ago and have not had a headache in 15 days. I had averaged a migraine every 2-3 days. If I was really lucky I might, just might go 4 days. So???? Curious way my Dr. didn't mention it knowing my history, but who cares. Praying it remains this way and thank you, God for this new lease on life.”","

I was previously on Cozaar, which also worked well, but cost $52.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have had high blood pressure since I was a teenager. My Drs have determined it's just genetics and something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. I've tried multiple medications since I was a teen and I was recently put on lisinopril with a water pill. It works. There are some side effects but nothing major for me and the important thing is my blood pressure hasn't been this low since I was a kid.”,1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Started taking Lisinopril last Fall. Since then I have experienced hives, itching non-stop, leg cramps at night and occasional blurred vision. I first thought the hives and itching were allergy associated and would just go away. Just today I started researching the side effects of this medicine and tomorrow I will go to see my doctor to see about getting it changed. I went from 5mg - 10mg - 20mg in about 9 mos., blood pressure is doing OK with this medicine but the side effects are just too much.”","

After 3 1/2 months it has worsened and I have been back to my doctor numerous times with a bronchial infection which has required me to be on antibiotics and steroids for four dosages.  My MD recommended I see a Pulmonologist which I have and had a CT scan along with putting me on three different inhalers.  Recently I had another lung infection and went to a local GP and have found that all of my issues are from the Lisinopril - blurry vision, extreme weight gain, Bronchiectasis which is severe.”",1

Lisinopril,Prinivil (lisinopril) for High Blood Pressure:,"“The cough with all the congestion is annoying. Everyone is always asking if I'm ill. My blood pressure is still averaging 190/124. BPM are around 90-135. I have been on 2.5 mg for 4 months with no change. I'm a 48 year old white female in a high pressured medical career.
No health insurance so my Dr. writes me Linsinopril because it is free. My next appointment is in 2 weeks. I'm sure he will make changes.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“At home my blood pressure was 127/80, but at the doctor I have 146/90 every visit. Doctor disregarded home readings and put me on 5 mg of lisinopril.
I started having trouble finishing my daily exercise routine, developed a cough, and my bp shot up to 171/119. I have anxiety without meds and I  became more anxious than I've ever been. 
I went back to my doctor who accused me of lying about the previous home readings, prescribed me a higher dose of lisinopril and sent me to the ER. ER did an EKG, said I was fine and sent me home.
The higher dose now is still resulting in a higher BP, with the addition of terrible headaches. I do not think I will consent to this medication again when I see my doctor in a few days”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Given the 5mg pale peach round tablet to try out for prehypertension 31 days ago. Lisinopril DID help my blood pressure. Pounding headaches, pounding heart at rest stopped.

Downside: I experienced what was most likely intestinal angioedema at the outset. I puffed up though I did not weigh more (3lbs LESS on one occasion). Hard to pass gas or have bowel movements and puffed up and uncomfortable in my lower abdomen most of the time.

Then I woke at 2am when my left eye shot open, turned red and started weeping freely. My lip and cheek on that side became slightly numb and swollen. I knew that I had to take a benadryl right away and stay up to make sure my throat didn't close up. My doc said take another benadryl and go straight to ER if my swelling got worse/went to my throat.

They gave me new hbp medicine and had me destroy my lisinopril.

Angioedema is a rare reaction to lisinopril, but BE VIGILANT. Especially those with allergies.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My pharmacy recently gave me Lisinopril made by Solco labs, which was different from the previous makers, Lupin. My blood pressure was under very good control with perfect readings under Lupin. However, the Solco brand  sent me to the ER with dangerously high readings, I’m talking stroke levels. Solco actually caused my blood pressure to spike instead of lowering it.
Other than the experience just noted, I have had absolutely no side effects with good BP control.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I had extremely high blood that my Dr. tried first  HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide), which is a diuertic, that didn't touch it, then atenolol, which helped but it was the added lisinipril that FINALLY got it down. Been on it now for 15 years. Recently my mom and her health problems made me more aware of my own and I talked with my doc about lisinipril. And read up on it. It is not metabolized by the liver like I originally thought which gives my liver a break. It isn't actually metabolized at all and is excreted wholly thru the urine. I have had NO side effects in all of the years I have taken it and it has kept my pressure under control without any additional increases in dosages. It is also covered by most insurances and is very cheap. I highly recommend this medication.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was on Lisinopril for a month. My blood pressure was under control for the first time in a long time.  One morning I woke up with some swelling to my face.  As the morning progressed, the symptoms got worse.  It was very painful for me to swallow.  I ended up going to the ER only to find I had an allergic reaction to the medicine which is common in African Americans.  I ended up in the hospital for 4 days.  After having some blood drawn, my liver enzyme levels were highly elevated.  After being off the medication, my liver enzyme levels are going down.  Now my pcp check my labs every two weeks to keep an eye on my liver enzyme levels.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Diagnosed  with high blood pressure over 20 years ago.  I have been on 10mg dose of Zestril, then the generic-Lisinopril. I have always had the annoying cough with it, but  with my family history of heart disease, I would just deal with it. Up until about 6 months ago, my lisinopril came from  Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Now my pharmacy said their wholesaler can’t get Mylan and instead have me on lisinopril manufactured by Lupin. I have been giving it a try, but it’s not working. My blood pressure was controlled previously, but since the switch it’s high, I am lightheaded and anxious. Not sure what’s with the coating of Lupin brand, but my stomach grumbles something fierce after I take it. I have not taken it for three days now and so far feel better. 

None of the pharmacies in my area carry Mylan lisinopril. 
I have a call in to my doctor to see what else she can recommend. We want our meds to come from US manufactures. Cheaper is not always better.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After a week of taking Lisinopril, I started coughing, a productive cough.  My doctor prescribed anti-biotics and allergy meds and I took them for almost a month with no relief.  He then prescribed steriods and a cough med with codeine.  I was okay for a week but my productive coughing came back.  I told my doctor it maybe caused by Lisinopril but he said that the side effect of it is dry cough but mine is productive cough.  After 3 months, my doctor said I could seek for a 2nd opinion and referred me to an ENT for a laryngoscopy.  The result, my nose and throat are normal.  The ENT doctor told me my coughing was due to Lisinopril.  I stopped taking Lisinopril and after 2 weeks my coughing stops. I hate Lisinopril.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This drug was quite effective for me for a long time. While I did cough some while taking it, it was never bothersome. Just recently, I did halt taking lisinopril, as I began experiencing facial and head tingling. I initially thought it was possibly stress or the multivitamins I also take. However, after eliminating the lisinopril, the facial and head tingling stopped, virtually immediately. So, as with anything, medications sometimes need to be re-evaluated for one's body.”","

Lisinopril,For Migraine Prevention:,“I had high blood pressure that turned out to be related to the job. My doctor put me on a low dose of linosipril and the blood pressure came down.  And my migraines stopped. I did not make the connection until I left the job and we took me off of the linosipril. The blood pressure was normal but the migraines were back.  I did a search for  migraine medications and found linisopril on the list. I went right back to the doctor who was  going to put me on Topamax and shared my findings. Two months on a low dosage of linisopril and no migraines. Woo hoo! Fingers are crossed and so far so good.  Best of all it is a free prescription at my local grocery store pharmacy. What a tremendous relief after years of having migraines run my life.”,"

It worked OK when I was in a very stressful job and works much better now that I am retired. I do have the runny nose issue but live in AZ so not sure if that is allergies. Based on what I have read in peoples comments, I am going to assume it is the meds. I also take what is called a water pill. The fatigue thing mentioned by many also applies to me. Erectile dysfunction is also a significant issue. I am considering getting off the medicines to see if that helps that issue. If anyone out there can provide any info on that matter, it would be appreciated.”","

I also became flushed it looked like a sunburn, the doctors overlooked this due to the fact that it was summer, however I had not been in the sun, cough, feeling agitated and very confused restless with intense change of smell. I felt confused. A loss of appetite, blurred vision, swollen eyes & lips. Chills, feeling hot, cough, sinuses swollen. Had to stop lisinopril.”",1

I quit taking it for a week or so and then I noticed my libido was back to its normal levels. Started taking it again, and then noticed that I was unable to have erections, maintain them, and I had absolutely no sex drive.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Because this works for some I will not say it is a bad medication. It did bring down my blood pressure, however, for the week I took it I could not sleep more than an hour or two at a time. I have both a pulse ox meter as well as a BP meter and started keeping close watch and found that while on Lisinopril my resting pulse went very low. It was 44 at one point and rarely went above 70. My Dr was not concerned because he said that it did not stay in the low range, however, in my conclusion I believe that I was not sleeping because my pulse went too low and I was forced to wake up in order to get my resting pulse to raise enough to keep me alive. After stopping the medication my resting pulse went back up to its normal rate of around 60-75.”","

Be tired all day.. Take a nap from 12-2pm and still go back to sleep tired at 8 pm. This is driving me nuts and has caused me to gain weight due to lack of activity.”","

Ended up in the ER.   Eye doctor didn't know what it was, internal medicine doctor tested me for all sorts of things, couldn't figure it out.

First symptom I got was cough that never went away. Annoyed everyone at work. Then I got twitches all over my body. In my arms and legs, but the most annoying was on my head. I had constant twitches on the left side of my head. I stopped the medicine and the twitches went away instantly. 

One of the worst symptoms was chest pain. Had to have ECG done and it came back abnormal. They think it was because lisinopril caused my sodium to drop low. Stopped lisinopril and it came back normal.

Something is wrong with this new pill. I hope that no one dies, or has a heart attack or stroke. I am calling the FDA today.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have ""auditioned"" eleven blood pressure medicines.  So far, lisinopril is the least objectionable.  For one thing, it really works.  My blood pressure is down to 117/78 at 10 a.m. This is on only 2.5 mg, which is 1/2 of the smallest tablet they make. Two months ago, before lisinopril, I went to the ER because I was at 170/104.  I do have a slight increase in head pain where I have had repeated craniotomies, but it is definitely less than any of the other medicines I've tried.  I also retain water, have some hair loss, have lower blood sugar (not good for me because I am hypoglycemic), and somewhat wakeful sleep.  But the worst symptom is that it makes me impotent to the point of penile atrophy.  A good medicine for women.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking 10mg Lisinopril 5 years ago. It worked to lower my HBP along w/ 100mg Metoprolol (110/70), and I only had a very minor cough. BUT I finally figured out after 5 years that it caused all of my MAJOR stomach issues over this time. We couldn't figure it out, so I gave up and cut a ton of foods out of my diet, which was miserable. I was switched to Losartan and my stomach issues went away OVERNIGHT and I'm able to eat like a normal person again. Lisinopril inflamed my GI tract and caused it to hurt constantly. I found out this could be called ""intestinal angioedema"" but my doctors are skeptical. It lowered my blood pressure, but I'm glad to be off of it and on something else that works just as well w/out side effects.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After taking 2 lisiniprol I broke out In a horrendous red rash over my entire body. Extreme itching. Angioedema, difficulty swollowing, eye sight compromosied, violent headache.  3 trips to ER, 3 days in hospital. 4 weeks later entire body skin peeling. Still very weak, short of breath on exertion. Bp elevated. Not sure what I will do about Bp as I am very afraid to try a new drug. This is a very bad drug.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am extremely sensative to prescriptions/medications. I do not take anything on a daily basis, but do take Advil, Musinex, and Aspirin as needed. After only a few days of taking 10mg I am so weak/tired I cannot function or drive. I am always ""tired"" but this is different. The first things that I noticed were SEVERE lower right back pain, tingling/numbness in my hands and feet, nausea, and ringing in my ears. Now I have swelling, a bad taste on the back of my tongue, slight shortness of breath, but if I am active it is bad and my heart pounds, burning pain similar to heart burn, and extreme weakness. I am not on others meds and did not have these symptoms until after I took this. I have only taken 3 pills in total.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have taken this medicine for 4 years now, 10mg once a day. I take it at night before bed. My blood pressure is great all the time. I had problems with my blood pressure after child birth and it never went away. But this medicine has been dependable and lowered it to normal. I do have a dry cough here and there mostly at night sometimes, when I don't drink the full glass of water. I get my blood checked every year to make sure it is not affecting my liver or kidneys. The only thing I noticed is that you cannot miss a dose, you will feel it if you do.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After taking this medicine for some 2 years I started to get swelling in the eye areas. Twice it just swelled up around the upper eye lids. Last night, during the night it swelled up completely the other eye, went to emergency room and the whole time I thought it was just allergies. The doctor said it was lisinopril and if I don't stop taking it, it could swell up the neck area and close off the breathing. If you are having this swelling, be sure to tell your doctor.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking this and its ruining me. I'm always dizzy and feeling like I'm about to fall out our pass out on the floor at home and at work, it's caused me to miss alot of work cause of the dizziness and uneasy feeling. I don't even want to take this anymore. Plus it makes me not so accepting of my finance with sex.. What kind of life is that. I believe this is the wrong medication fit me.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This medicine needs to be discontinued. I've been on Lisinopril  for about 4 years. Out the blue on Monday, the right side of my lip began to swell. I took a Benadryl and prayed,  I would wake up in the morning to see my personal physician.  The nonchalant attitude I was presented with left me speechless. Knowing the side effects and the danger  of this medication, why is it still on the market? Shame on yall!!!”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After reading most of the other reviews I wonder if I am on proper med.  I have been taking since 12/24/16.  Within 2 days my b/p was very close to normal.  I do have slight headache, mild confusion and some dizziness.  However, headaches were worse before taking this drug and also suffered from other side effects prior to taking it.  I feel the benefits outweigh the adverse effects.  Thank you.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I had been watching my Bp for a while and knew it was a bit on the marginal side of high. When I finally decided to go see my Dr about it, was when it was 212/110. Couldn't get it below 186/94 no matter what I did. So, he put me on 20mg with 25mg hctz. Within the week (yesterday was one week) of being on it, my Bp at highest point is 151/86 and generally runs in the 130s over 67 to 76 at the highest. The only problem I'm having is I'm tired!”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm 18, I've been on Lisinopril 20mg for a year. My BP stays around 120/80 which is good. When swim season came, I had been trying to get into shape but fatigued too easily in practice to ever get a good workout in. At my first swim meet, I almost had a heart attack after a race. Lisinopril cured my high BP but ended my swimming career. If your a serious athlete, I don't recommend taking this medicine. Its effective but your endurance will diminish greatly.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Being on that med kept my bp right for a long time,but it also caused my kidneys to fail.So make sure you have your M.D.pay close attention to your BUN and your creatnine levels.You pay attention to it as well.All beta blockers cause a problem if you stay on the same one for an extended period of time.Don't let the Dr.tell you nothing about what you should and shouldn't take.Research and tell him no if it aint for you.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed 10-20mg daily for high blood pressure. I do believe it did what it was supposed to do, and much more. While taking it, I developed a very annoying throat tickle which was accompanied by excessive mucus production in my throat. This would happen during the day and also went on all night to the point I would wake up literally gagging until I got it all hacked up. It got progressively worse the longer I took it and my wife was at her wits end with my excessive snoring. Also, I found that I was much less alert while on the drug to the point I rear ended at car on my commute to work one morning. I would highly advise anyone to take this medication with extreme caution. I have since stopped taking and all side effects are gone.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I took this for a year and it seem to have worked well or so I thought.  Until I started coughing thinking it was my sinuses.  Then shortness of breath when walking long distances.   I was sleeping good until the final night I woke up with my throat closing up, my tongue swollen this reaction landed me in intense care with kidney problems.  I will be going to a specialist for the rest of my life to what this med has done.  When my family has been prescribed this medicine I recommend  them not to take this.  Why is is it on the market it can prove fatal if medical intervention is not taken.  The physician in the hospital told me lisinipril taken for a day or years can go against your health.  Why has this medication still prescribed?”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My experience with lisinopril was a short one. I have had slightly elevated BP since I was in my early 20's but never did anything about it until I was in my late 30's. I was given low dose lisinopril first. I took it maybe 3 months which was my scheduled follow-up with my doctor. Almost immediately after I started taking it, the coughing began. No other side effects that I am aware of. I told the doctor about the cough and he switched me to a low dose of losartan. Cough was gone immediately. That was over 10 years ago and no issues at all with losartan and it works as intended for lowering my BP.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This medicine worked so well on my friend, but for me I start coughing like crazy for a whole week before I did find it was Lisinopril that makes me cough. I changed the medicine to Amlodipine and it was a nightmare. I just come back from the doctors office he changed me to Cozaar. I hope this medicine will work for me.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“The very irritating post nasal drip, runny nose, and cough has disrupted my life!  I thought I had allergies or a cold and it took me months to connect it to lisinopril.  I see my Dr. tomorrow and will be so glad to get rid of this drug and its side effects.  My sleep was interupted all night so I was not getting adequate rest.  And at work it was embarrasing to keep blowing my nose and coughing.  People are hyper-aware of germs these days because of the swine flu thing, (and I work in surgery.)”","

Lisinopril,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I've had severe headaches/migraines about twice a month since I was about seven years old. As an adult, my headaches were brutal: 36 hours of feeling like I'd been shot in the left eye, and NOTHING helped.  I always had low-to-normal blood pressure until it jumped up post-menopause despite my being thin, active, a non-smoker, etc. The hypertension meds I tried either made my headaches worse or made me so tired I could barely get out of bed. Lisinopril also made me tired, but to a degree that I figured I could live with. A few months later, I realized I hadn't had a headache since I'd started taking it. Fifteen months later I am still migraine-free. Unbelievable!”","

Long story short I have been on Lisinopril for a couple of years with no problems...or so I thought. Increased to 40mg about 6 months ago. Vision changes, significant...but I also had a near fatal truck accident....so were the visual changes from the crash???or the anti-hypertensive??? Also increase in really bad anxiety...oh so lovely - the kind where you feel like you could jump out of your skin. Now not to be a downer, yes the med brought my B/P down and for that alone I am very grateful. I am just annoyed that the possible side effects were not shared.

Debilitating pain including weakness/pain in shoulders. Driving was difficult. Occasional sharp stabbing  pain under right shoulder blade. Charlie horse in lower calfs in middle of night. I am dedicated to exercise and have been unable to participate in activities. Two weeks after starting (3 days ago) saw Dr for follow up visit. She actually laughed when hearing of my neck and shoulder pain ""I've never heard of this."" She actually asked if I'm sure I  didn't do something to cause it. I also mentioned that I just don't feel good...my head feels funny. (It did lower my bp.) I haven't taken anything for 3 days and my neck pain almost gone...I can turn my head now. Shoulder blade pain subsiding. Thinking of getting a new Dr.”","

The second night of taking this ACE inhibitor I ended up in the E.R.  The first night I took it I felt funny but figured this was a normal because my body was trying to adjust.  That night I woke from a dead sleep and couldn't catch my breath.  I passed out and woke up to my girlfriend (God bless her heart) shaking me.  All I know is it really scared me and made me question a lot of things about my health choices and life.  No one I love will be taking this medication.  I feel like I could have died but know my body's safeguard mechanism kept me alive.  Do not take.”,"

It's a heavy feeling that just sits there (upper middle abdomen) Well tonight or rather about 4 hours ago he had the same discomfort in upper abdomen with tenderness, bloated feeling, increase in burping, diarrhea, nausea that later progressed to vomiting.

After starting with lisinopril and a diuretic, the medication was lowered to just 20 mg lisinopril/day and then to 10 mg/day because I experienced extreme fatigue. The medicine has lowered my BP but there appears to be still the fatigue every few days associated with a drop in my pulse to 40 or even less beats/min. I appear now to have a ""normal"" at rest pulse of 58-60/min when it was about 70 with no drops and fatigue. I am wondering if anyone else has noticed a drop in pulse associated with their fatigue?

After 6 months the ED was much worse - I found a study online that showed 80% of men over 60 who took lisinopril developed or made worse, their ED.

My husband took me to the urgent care center and from there I was taken to the emergency room at the hospital via ambulance.  I couldn't believe this was happening.  I knew it was something wrong but did not think it was too serious to be taken to the hospital. I was given benadryl thru an I..V. and other meds.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“It worked good for 4 years, 20mg Lisinopril, then the doctor added 50mg Metoprolol twice a day. I've had the wheezing and slight cough and it raised my blood sugar a few points, but the worst side effect of all is the runny nose. As a single guy in his 50's it's quite a challenge to go out to met women with your nose in a constant drip. But it works, has less side effects than others.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have the type of BP that will shoot up in the doctor's office, even if I go in for a hang nail.  Yes, it was somewhat high at home 130's/80-90.   I was put on 20, and hated that the quality of my life is terrible due to exhaustion/tiredness/sleepiness from the pill.  I insisted on trying 10 mg, but of course my BP jumped up in the doctor's office.  I'm back on 20, but I don't know if it's worth living this way.  The tiredness makes me depressed and makes me feel old.  When I quit the pills, the sleepiness goes away.  I'm not really overweight, but I'm going to try to lose more to see if that helps.  I do exercise, but in the winter, I often don't do as much and the exhaustion doesn't help.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Despite the reactions of some earlier reviewers, one of the reasons I prefer lisinopril to the others I've tried is that I do NOT feel dizzy.  Nor do I feel groggy as I did on quinapril.  I do find that I don't sleep well, and it does contribute to impotence.  It also works really well, and I can get by on a smaller dose.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Have taken it for about 6 months for systolic pressure.  Started at 10 mg and it seemed to have worked.  About a couple of months ago the systolic pressure started going up so got switched to 20 mg.  Again, that worked until it started going up last week.  Doctor said I can take two pills, so I take it twice a day, to what appears to be no effect.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've enjoyed everyone`s experiences and opinions, however, you all have mentioned your blood pressure readings, but have not said anything about your pulse rate. So I thought I would bring that up because I've had some low pulse rates, anyone else? My Doctor started me on Lisinopril 5 mg eight days ago. I have been testing my Blood Pressure at home and have a chart that I record the readings on so I can spot any sudden changes. My lowest Blood Pressure Reading was 95 over 65, pulse 60. To me that`s scary. My highest reading was 153 over 84, pulse 95. This is due to extreme pain in my Lumbar. I was hit by a semi-dump truck T-Bone style at my drivers door. It messed up 3 disk in my lumbar. I refused back surgery, already had neck surgery.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking this horrible drug for about 9 months.  I slowly began to feel more fatigued until I had extreme fatigue where I could not function at work and was sleeping up to 18 hours per day.  I was constantly lightheaded and it got to where I did not want to stand at all.  I was also nauseated, had extreme brain fog, and became abnormally moody because if this.  I had no time left at work and will probably have to take a warning because of the time I did have off.  I figured it out without help from my doctor.  They would not believe me so I took myself off and I am trying lifestyle changes, fish oil, and baby aspirin.  I feel much better after only 3 days off this medication.  I would never take this again.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“I used lisinopril for two months. It worked fine the first 4 month.Then My teeth were hurting. I thought it was nothing. Then a week later my jaw was hurting. I thought it was sinuses. So I let it go  I went to my dentist and they took xrays and said thete was absolutely nothing wrong with my teeth. My family doctor put me on 3000 mg antibiotics for a week she thought it we as a bad sinus infection. In mean time I googled the side effects . Believe it or not lisinopril was causing all that pain. My doctor took me of the medc right away and placed me on another bp.  So everyone thats taking the pill please be carful and pay attention to your body. My teeth pain went away that same day and my jaw don't hurt.”,"

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm a 27 year old white male in good shape but have always had high blood pressure...I'm guessing genetic. My blood pressure would run anywhere from 130-160 over 85-105. The doctor tried a diuretic which did nothing, and then a beta blocker which had horrible side effects. They finally tried 10mg of lisinopril and wow how great! It almost immediately brought my blood pressure to 118/80's. I actually cut my dose to 2.5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg at lunch and my blood pressure stays perfect all day and night. I have had no side effects whatsoever and wouldn't even know I was taking any medication if it weren't for my lowered blood pressure. Highly recommend!”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on this for about a week and am anxious to get off of it.  I was taking Atenolol before with little side effects and before that Bystolic.  I had to move from Atenolol to Bystolic because of the price increase.  A week ago, Atenolol seemed to  have stopped working for me.  I was also experiencing swollen ankles, something I had never experienced before.  The doctor told me my blood pressure was too high and my pulse too low and described Lisinopril which I started on a Tuesday.  My blood pressure went down nicely and my pulse rate went up.  Unfortunately, by Saturday my rate dropped so low that I passed out.  And tonight my pulse is over 100.  I never experienced such a wide range of numbers before.  
I have an appointment this Thurs., but am thinking of doing a walk in tomorrow after reading this.  
I also have noticed a lack of ambition, a need to sit down (feeling weak).  I am usually an avid reader, but have no desire to even do that. Not happy with this drug at all.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am a person who worries about adverse side effects and almost passed on taking this drug based on reviews. Sure glad that I did not.

Lisinopril,For Migraine Prevention:,"“My doctor prescribed lisinopril for my blood pressure. She is an osteopath and very much into prevention. I'm not even sure my blood pressure is high. I've gone a few weeks without it and when I do my re check at the doc is 120/70. That happened a few times. But my point is, it really helped with my hormonal headaches. Now I'm period free and totally migraine free for 5 years. So hopefully you hormone migraine sufferers will have the same luck. It does give me that little annoying dry cough, but I'd say it's worth it.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking lisinopril for about 4 years as a preventative to the medication I take for my type 2 diabetes. My dosage started at 10mg and 12.5 hctz. I also have anxiety issues. I've read most of the comments here, and my side effects were very minimal with the exception that my hair became very thin and the texture changed. Has anyone else experienced this? I couldn't take it anymore due to becoming dependent on wigs and weaves. My doctor changed me to Losartan HCTZ 50-12.5. I am praying my hair will grow back.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm a 27-year-old male with hypertension (yes, a bit young, but it runs in the family). At first, Lisinopril was a God send. We were seeing systolic pressure in the high 120s and diastolic pressure in the 70s (I've had readings as high as 165 over 95). I didn't develop the dreaded ""ACE inhibitor cough."" Overtime, however, lisinopril caused me to feel fatigued 24/7. I'm depressed (despite 40mg Prozac per day and no history of major depressive disorder or triggers) and feel 50 years older than I should be.

Medications affect different people in so many different ways. I'll continue on my quest to find the blood pressure  medicine that works for me (...with a second opinion from a cardiologist).”","

Instead of taking  me off and trying something else, which btw, I have been on dozens over the years.
She just increases the dosage.
I feel like I am carrying a backpack on my back loaded with heavy rocks.
It drains my energy.
That is why I dont take it first thing in the am, because I walk and if I take this first, I feel so slow, I feel like sitting down.
I guess these drugs are designed this way, but it is not a good thing for anyone who wants to be active.
I try to eat healthy, gave up salt, and soda and just try to exercise when I can.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide for about 6 weeks. My BP was high (200/100) after an especially stressful day so I went to the Dr. to see about getting medication. I started on a dose of 12.5/20mg but had side effects, including dizziness and extreme exhaustion in the afternoon. Then my BP started getting a little too low. So my Dr. suggested I cut the dose in half. So far that seems to be working. I'm less dizzy and my BP is usually in the ""ideal"" range after I take it. However, I do have digestive problems that I never experienced before, so I think it's related to the pills. I'm hoping to lose weight so I can come off this pill but for now will keep taking the half pill. The key thing is to check your BP at certain times to make sure you have the proper dose. Some Drs are pill pushers who create more problems for their patients than necessary. However, it IS important to keep your BP in check, so take medication if needed and monitor it closely.

I went to see her and could hardly drive, I was ready to pass out a the wheel of the car.  When I got there my BP was 100/50.  It is a miracle I made it there.

Doctor said that lisinopril was not cause of constipation and said to use miralax for a week. After 5 days, miralax did nothing. I called the doctor and told of this experience. The doctor still thinks the bowel problem is unrelated to the medication. But said stop for a week, track blood pressure and see if bowel trouble continues.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have come back to report - after giving this medicine a very negative rating.

It is now a year down the road and the medicine no longer gives me negative side effects.

In fact, it delivers a consistently superior blood pressure, much lower than the normal range.  I have gone from a blood pressure reading of 190/150 to 98/66.

I continue to drink coffee freely and my blood pressure never rises above 115/70.

I wish to take back all the negative things I said concerning doctors who prescribe this medicine.

Lisinopril must receive a rating of ""10"" on the efficiency scale.

However, one glaring side effect of this medicine is impotence and some aphrodisiac should always be prescribed to restore sexual function to the one who uses this medicine.”","

The doctor also added Cardizen CD last year, as I had an episode of rapid heartbeat (over 200bpm) while in his office, and he sent me to the ER.

Well anyway I whited out and assaulted the Officer, I do not remember this happening what so ever. that week I went to the Dr and told him what was happening, he said that with some people lisinopril does have these effects on people therefore he changed my medication. looking through the web I also found that if you are allergic to Sulfa meds Lisinopril should not be taken.”","

Working out 5-6 times per week lost 12 lbs so far. Not really into meds like that would like to be off completely in a few months. Headaches from time to time, or more like pressure in head. Muscles aches, but maybe due to working out(body is not used to being taken care of) trying to quit smoking as well, cause bp to rise. Drinking about 10 cups of water per day, add lemon for flavor.

Convinced it’s the med, as I felt fine before- and doesn’t feel like your typical stomach bug. The cramps are what sets it apart. Terrible. Finally started to dissipate about 6am and I got a couple hours of sleep. Just ate a piece of toast now and Gatorade.. hoping it continues to get better today- I’m NOT taking another dose. I’ll have to wait til Monday now to call the dr office and tell them.  I am going on vaca tues and am not taking a chance that I’ll be sick! I’m going to continue to research more natural ways to lower my BP and maybe try CoQ10.”","

Lisinopril,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Doctor put me on 10 MG for high blood pressure and my horrible nightly migraines that I have had for 20 years stopped immediately!  I could not believe it. The doctor didn't mention this possibility, only the cough, which I have a touch of and will put up with. I just googled the drug and found the migraine effect on my own after 2 days of no headache. It has only been 10 days so I am keeping my fingers crossed, but so far I am stunned! I have Zomig for the migraines but it was usually an hour or so process in the middle of the night to get it to kick in. I cannot believe how much more rested I feel, not having to be up in pain every night. Sure hope it is effective on my blood pressure too.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“PLEASE, mention what the pharmaceutical company your lisinopril is from!  

Sometime over the last few months(?), Lupin Pharmaceutical has changed tablet sizes (I think in all dosages).  My brother is on this medication, has been for 8 years.  He hadn't really noticed the pill size change because he recently changed pharmacies also.  Within the last couple of months, he has had some symptoms that he wasn't sure why he was having.  Primarily, dizziness and lightheadedness, which has also stirred up his anxiety, and fluctuations in BP and heart rate (both going VERY low).  He decreased dose, then stopped taking.  Then BP spiked.  Took lower dose again, and dizziness is back, anxiety is back.  Viscous cycle with little answers at this point.”","

Lisinopril,For Coronary Artery Disease:,"“My friend age 53 began taking Lisinopril after a double coronary bypass June this year. We asked for the Lisinopril prescription from the doctor because it was cheap and he was going to need a long term ACE inhibitor. He had a history of bronchitis in the past. As time rocked on the cough became worse eventually being put on a home nebulizer. The Physician Assistant changed him from Lisinopril to Diovan. Within 2 weeks the cough had gone away, as well as the wheezing and no longer needed the resp treatments. Personally I feel that Lisinopril is a good medicine if one has no other medical issues. In this case I think it was not a good choice. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am in my early 40's.  I was prescribed Lisinopril (10mg) to treat high blood pressure.  After a subsequent visit to my doctor, it was determined that 10mg was not dropping my blood pressure and he prescribed 20mg.  This has caused a mild side effect of a constant dry cough and unfortunately, it did not drop my blood pressure either.  I am now taking AMLODIPINE BESYLATE but just started it so I don't have enough history with it to tell if it will work.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was 150/110 so they put me on one a day. BP went back to normal. However, this causes me some stomach discomfort and makes me lightheaded. The big problem though is the fatigue. I can't do very much work on this and it's like I feel I always have to sit or lay down. I might as well use cannabis, which also lowers BP without the side effects. I had to give it a high rating though because it's doing what it is supposed to do.”","

Lisinopril,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I've been taking imitrex for migraines 8 to 12 times a month for as long as I can remember and taking excedrine on almost a daily basis for milder headaches.

I haven't experienced the cough that some have, so for me this has been a great experience.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“BP med I was one was Valsartan but was recalled. Started on  lisinopril 40mg. Worked great! Good BP numbers, maybe too low. So after visiting with pharmacist, cut pill in half to 20mg. Worked great. Then ... after a week the dry coughing started. After a month I was coughing off and on all night and multiple times during the day. Worn out. I returned to the doctor who changed my prescription to Losartan, which I have taken for five days. The doctor and nurse—and pharmacist—all said coughing is a common issue with Lisinopril. I would give the pill an 8 for how well it works for BP, yet downgraded it to 5 due to coughing. Nonetheless, I would not take this pill again. As with all medications, I’m sure it works for some; not for others.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Lisinopril has actually worked very well at lowering my BP, but it really wasn't that high to begin with (140/84), now I am pretty much consistent at (128/79), sometimes lower.  My only issue with the drug, is the constant lightheaded feeling, especially in the mornings, when I am extremely dizzy.  I tried to stop taking lisinopril, but my body reacted strange.  My Systolic was good, but my Diastolic was above 85, and my legs felt like they were on fire and weak.

I am going to speak to my pcd tomorrow about this.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Blood pressure droped from 140's over low 100's to 120's over mid 80's in just days.  So far no side effects.  Doctor said there may be a dry cough but they could change to a related medication that would not cause the cough, which would be more expensive. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was taking Lisinopril for about 6 months for my blood pressure which was 150/103...it went down to about 115/70 which is good.  But I develped the ""ACE cough"" like abut 15% of people do who take an ACE inhibitor.  I had to keep cough drops and hard candy with me at all times and it was really embarrassing in my classes to cough so much.  I also lost feeling in the tips of my fingers and toes a lot, and occasionally felt like my face and lips were swelling.  So finally I had my doctor switch me to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) and all of my symptoms have gone away that I can tell.  I have to go to the bathroom a little more often but that is way better than coughing all the time.  I'm hoping it will work for my high blood pressure too.”","

If your light headed and feel like you're tired you need a lesser dose. HIgh Blood pressure, versus low blood pressure, will make you feel bad or feel like garbage. Feeling great with hIgh BP is not good, is merely you got used to a different pressure.  Others complaining are attributing side effects to other diseases like infections or other things.

The dry cough started about 1 year ago and I just never really connected the two.

At first, I wondered if I developed an allergy to a food that I was eating (as I have been in medicine for nearly 22 years). Then, magically, when I stopped taking the Solco version of Lisinopril all of these symptoms went away. It was the only thing I could think of as the cause.

Along with that are Statin drugs!  After suffering from nerve damage and learning about the Statin drugs, I quit taking simvastatin. But could not understand why the neuropathy continued to get worse anyway, Only to find out that lisinopril, which I had continued to take also causes peripheral neuropathy. Drug manufacturers produce these medication‘s to supposedly help or cure one problem, but they do not care even one bit how much other damage it can do to the patient.

I stopped taking them when my pressure seemed stable (it's never worryingly very high anyway) and sure enough my migraines returned. My blood pressure was normal so I was put on different types of medicines with all the most negative side effects under the sun to try to keep the migraines at bay but they didn't help other than make me groggy and sick.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have no coughing from this medicine. It is low cost and easy to take. My only concern was leg cramps. With exercise every other day they will go away. You must exercise and take care of yourself on any drug or just as a daily routine in your quality of life. ”,"

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I took Lisinopril for approximately five months and could no longer take the coughing.  Initially I was tired all the time.  It had been prescribed to take every morning.  I called my doctor and we switched to taking in the evenings so I would sleep better and that cleared the lethargy.  However the cough never went away.  It was violent and painful (headaches and feeling like ribs were bruised), caused huge disruptions at work, interrupted my sleep, and caused me to pee - even if I had just emptied my bladder.  I found out this was a common side effect and called my doctor today to switch to something new.  I start Losartan tomorrow.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“This is a very dangerous drug and should be taken off the market! I wound up in A & E twice within a few days because I felt like I'd had a heart attack and could drop off any minute. It gave me severe pressure in my chest on both sides of my lower ribcage and back and it got so bad I could barely stand up without being completely breathless! The burning back pain was so bad I couldn't sleep either or lay on my side as I felt severely winded.”,"

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“I was given this medication after being prescribed several beta blockers and not tolerating them very well- I have PVCs and heart block which made it difficult to find a medication that helped my hypertension and did not aggravate my arrhythmia.  My hypertension was severe (generally 180/130 average) and I started with a dose of 10mg plus 20 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic).  That did not lower my blood pressure enough so I was bumped to 20 mg of lisinopril without the hydrochlorothiazide.  My blood pressure now averages 120/85 unless I am in a stressful situation.  I have the occasional dry cough but am tolerating this medication very well and it has not had any effect on my PVCs and heart block.  I am happy with this medication.”,"

The pain in my lower back was so extreme I could hardly walk or sleep, so I went to prompt care on Wednesday thinking it might be a UTI, Test was negative, doctor ordered PT. Next day I ended up in ER, bp was extremely high, rapid heart rate, felt like I was gonna pass out, all tests were negative, doctor said it was the new med and dehydration. I called my primary, I told her about the symptoms I was having, she said back pain wasn't a side effect of this drug, and the other symptoms were my body getting used to the drug.”","

In past 3-4 months occasional dry night cough, restlessness/poor sleep, night/day sweats (not menopause); and in past 4 weeks extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and most irritating either bloatedness or weight gain.  Noted that the lisinopril changed 3 months ago from a small white pill to oval pinkish pill.  Am physically active (brisk walk with Border Collie, & dance 2-3-4 times a week).  Then thought maybe I need to reduce from 10mg back to 5mg until I began checking symptoms.  Seeing Dr to discuss dc'g this - replacing with baby aspirin especially reading concerns posted here.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Lisinopril worked great for lowering blood pressure even at a very low dose.  Unfortunately, the dry cough, that seemed to always be worse at night, eventually became more than I could endure.  The cough ended after 2 days.  In addition, I had developed a post nasal drip that I had never experienced before which also disappeared after 2 days.  I am now on Diovan but so far it has not lowered my blood pressure.  Really frustrating.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Been on medication for hbp for 7 months (also taking Bystolic). Had a reaction of angioedema where my face swelled and then a few days later got hives on my arms and legs. ER doctor explained it's technically NOT an allergic reaction (i.e. not histamine related) so benadryl will not help with the swelling. Given predisone and also taking tylenol. He told me the drug can be taken for decades without any adverse reaction, and then one day, you suddenly get swelling. Having a reaction rules out using any of the ACE inhibitor drugs. Too bad - it was working really well for me. On Cardizem now.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm a 60 yo male and have been on 10mg Lisinopril for around 1 year, along with Coreg CR. The Coreg wasn't doing its job completely so my PC Dr. added Lisinoprel. It dropped my BP somewhat, looking at making some adjustments in the near future. I've had no side effects, except that, from reading the many reviews, developed an occasional deep dry cough ( I thought it was my seasonal allergies). Not sure what my Dr. will prescribe, but the medicine seems to be doing its job.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Not working at all. I had valve repair in June. BP was fine until August then it started to go up. I also monitor it daily. Was put on Coreg first and still am on it.  Last visit 3 weeks ago they also put me on Lisinopril 10 mg. Has not done a thing to help none of my numbers are lower and are the same as when just on Coreg. Fortunately am not experiencing side effects.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I suffer from alcoholism binges and take atenolol, clonidine, and amloapine, as well as OTC vitamins on a daily basis. When my doctor's intern added a prescription for Lisinopril (10 mg x1 a day) it was the first time in 25 years of drinking that I had a case of Delirium Tremens (very nasty and horrifying experience). I have had alcohol withdrawal symptoms may times before and had to go to the ER a few times for a few hours while they detoxed me. But this was like nothing I have ever experienced. I couldn't stand up without falling over, and had to get around on my hands and knees. I would normally take a cab to the ER, but I wouldn't even make it to the cab. Had to call 911 for paramedics to the tune of $1250.00. No more Lisinopril for me.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am 55 years old, blood pressure ran from about 150-180 (systolic). Lisinopril (20mg) got my blood pressure to about 120/80. No side effects noted. My liver profile is normal, but I have noted my TSH, and fT4 drift a little high then normal. Having taken up exercise, reduced salt intake, etc, my blood pressure will be about normal without the drug.
It seems as though my fT4 and TSH tend to elevate when on lisinopril. I have just noticed this over the past 2 months.
I am now keeping records of when I take the drug over a week then will do repeat thyroid function tests to see if there is a trend. ”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“20mg was a very effective dose for treating my Hypertension however I did experience a bit of lightheadedness with the full 20mg tablet.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I began taking lisinopril about 10 months ago and after about 2 months, I began having a dry, hacking cough. I didn't pay particular attention to it at first, but it increased, as time went by. After the third month of coughing, I decided that I had better go to the Doctor, as I KNEW I had a very serious problem with my throat. One of my daughters was put on blood pressure medicine and she informed me that her Doctor told her that was one of the side effects. After much thought, considering the timing and reading, I am certain that it is the Lisinopril causing my problem. ”",1

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Since my gastroenterologist suggests avoiding Norvasc (amlodipine) because of my GERD, my PCP switched me to lisinopril. I started experiencing the usual cough but other symptoms I started experiencing and have had over the last 4 months since I started taking it I did not immediately link to this drug. These included upper and mid-back pain, headaches, dizziness at times, chest discomfort and possibly even elevating my blood sugar levels and with little impact on my hypertension when compared to Norvasc. I told my doctor that I have the GERD very much under control and just cannot stand the side effects of lisinopril so we switched back to the Norvasc. It will be interesting to see how quickly the side effects of the lisinopril subside.”","

I don't really know if the Lisinopril is working, or if it's due to the lifestyle changes I made in conjunction. I've been on it for over a month now and what I do notice is since a week or two ago, to this day, I get very, very itchy at night. It feels like little ants biting me.

I’ll never take this again. Like other reviews I’ve read I will continue to eat right and exercise. I’m not over weight at all and I will overcome the condition.

The cough got so bad I had to take breaks from the medication just to get relief. Finally my doctor recently took me off of it. She said the cough was a sign of an allergic reaction. I'm upset it took that long to get my doctor to understand that I was suffering with a cough/headache that seem to last 24/7. However, Lisinopril did lower my blood pressure.”","

What I'm wondering is, since these are generic, was it possible that it came down to the manufacture of Lisinopril.  
So too those of you that are headache free, make note of the company that is making it and if you wouldn't mind, share the company name.”",1

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I used lisinopril for about 10 years for hypertension secondary to polycystic kidney disease.  Most of that time I spent at a 20mg dose and had an occasional dry cough, usually at night.  However, it controlled my blood pressure well for most of that time and the cough wasn't persistent.  We recently increased my dose to 30mg and I immediately developed a severe and persistent dry cough.  It was so bad that I was taking two doses of Nyquil a night (once at bedtime, once ~4am) to subdue the cough and get to sleep.  So, we discontinued the lisinopril.”","

Lisinopril,For Heart Failure:,"“Have been on a combination of Lisinopril 5mg and Acebutolol 200mg daily for 21 years, due to valve leakage.  BP and rate without meds is 112/72 (78), with this combination 94/54 and (56) is ""normal"" for me.  Resting can go as low as 86/46 (48) without issue.  Works VERY well to reduce BP and consequently leakage.  I do have some issues with stomach acid, mild ED, Raynaud's, and occasional light headedness on standing; BUT cannot confirm that most of those are solely related to Lisinopril, and can be counteracted with other meds.

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Lisinopril is a miracle drug.  I'm probably alive today because of Lisinopril.  It works perfectly.  120/78.  All I will say is that by taking this medicine, it gives you yet one more excuse NOT to exercise.  The medicine does the work of exercise for lowering blood pressure.”",1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have had pre hypertension for years but then went higher so doc recommended this. No side effects that I notice but because my bp varies so much -it can hit 140's sometimes and then drop to 110 at nite. It really can drop big time with a glass of vino.  I definitely have white coat syndrome-160 at docs then down to 130's or lower after I leave- at nite sometimes 105 or lower below 100!  I have been taking it off and on and debated with my doc about it -he says take it...I have no idea what to do !  but it does protect all the organs..(20 mg lisinopril)”,"

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,“Doctor said I don't have high blood pressure but he states that he would like to see my blood pressure lower than what it is. I started off with 10 mg and I had an dry cough every once in a while but what I have noticed is that my body always felt hot but now I can put my hand on my neck and I don't feel hot anymore. Oh by the way my doctor stated that the blood pressure did drop and to continue to use it. Now that I'm remembering at first I was dizzy and felt weird but after 3 months I feel no more dizziness. I'll continue to use it. ”,1
Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Appears to be working fine. 10 mg. taken daily along with Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg. twice daily has reduced my blood pressure from 150 over 80 before my heart attack and bypass surgery to 116 over 64 after the surgery and after beginning the medications. I was 54 at time of heart attack, 55 at time of quintuple bypass surgery. Currently age 57.

Side effects: Lisinopril alone caused slight scratchy throat and mild cough at first, but those effects went away after about a year. No fatigue with Lisinopril alone, however now after a 10-hour shift at work, I am severely fatigued, but that didn't start until I started taking the Metoprolol Tartrate. I now fall into bed immediately after returning home from work, but attribute to the Metoprolol.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I basically have generally positive review, but there are some issues which I have with this medication - mostly dealing with the dosing. 
I originally was prescribed 5 mg of lisinopril many years ago. The medication was to be taken once per day.  The medication did a fine job! Had no side effects, and blood pressure was well controlled. Fast forward to earlier this year: my doctor wrote a prescription for 20mg lisinopril, dosed twice per day. My blood pressure went up to 160/105. I simply cannot handle lisinopril dosed twice daily - even with another medication like metoprolol ER added to the mix.  Additionally, the side effects - including a nasty burning sensation in my chest and dry, hacking cough appeared. None of those side effects showed up when taking lisinopril once a day.”","

Then I had an outbreak that within a day covered my entire body (there were plate sized hives that overlapped, with smaller outbreaks on top. My mouth and throat began swelling, and I got to ER asap. Very close to anaphylaxis. Learned that this is known side effect of Lisinipril. Package warning is not clear enough.”","

Lisinopril,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was switched to lisinopril from atenolol because it appeared  atenolol (taken for years but recent dosage increase) caused  rash on my neck. Started lisinopril 10 mg on a Tuesday, by Friday, the skin around my neck, and ears was thickened, blistered, and oozing. Went to doctor the following Monday- rash still attributed to atenolol. BP still high, doctor said go up to 20 mg of lisinopril. Took another 10 mg within 2 hours, neck swelling, face and mouth began to itch. I knew angioedema was a side effect of Lisinopril because it happened to my 26 year old son when he took it for his blood pressure.  Went to the ER, was told it was reaction to the drug.  Knee started to hurt at the same time. Within 24-48 hours of stopping Lisinopril, rash, swelling, skin thickening began to go away. Within 3 days, skin still red, but all blistering, flaking, and raised areas gone. Knee pain has not gotten better and is actually worse when I try to stretch or exercise. Horrible experience.”","

Every muscle and joint in my body is throbbing and hurting almost beyond what I can stand!! Its the absolute worst feeling and wouldn't wish it on anyone!!!

Now the shortness of breath is getting worse, I  have lower back pain, tingling in my hands which comes and goes.  I  told my doctor she said it should pass but  it's been a year and it hasn't past. The cough is getting worse so I think I'll stop this pill before it does anymore damage and then I'll find a new doctor as well.

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“Was on Toprol XR for only 6 weeks and had to get off of it quickly. HORRIBLE anxiety/panic attacks, constant arrhythmia, tachycardia, passing out, hypoglycemia, hallucinations, nightmares, Raynaud's syndrome, etc. This drug almost finished me off. I had 13 severe panic attacks since starting it; and if I wasn't as healthy a person as I am, I am certain it would have given me a heart attack. I am now exactly 8 weeks off of it. Most of the horrible symptoms have stopped, except the arrhythmia that comes and goes. In my opinion, Toprol is a serious endocrine disrupter and should be pulled from the market. It is a very dangerous drug. Can't believe how sick I became after starting it. Screw all pills. I can control my BP with diet. I truly regret ever putting one of these poisonous pills in my mouth.”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have not only super high blood pressure but also very high pulse & physical anxiety symptoms. It's idiopathic; I'm young, slim & female, with good diet & no aggravating lifestyle factors. I've been this way since age 18. Tried several solutions including OTC & prescription medications, diet changes & hippie-dippie placebo stuff like breathing exercises/meditation. Currently I'm on 3 meds for my BP. The only one I really miss when I skip it is metoprolol. If I skip my ACE inhibitor or my diuretic, there's barely any difference. Skip my metoprolol? I'd better call in sick.

You shouldn't give a hoot about my experience; my body chemistry has nothing to do with yours. Your body may not give a damn about beta blockers but care everything about a calcium channel blocker for all we know. All bodies are different, with a different reaction to different meds. I can't believe we're still reviewing medication like it's a one-size-fits-all deal that we can take each other's advice on.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Getting off this medication is brutal.
I only took it for 2 months and I was never sicker.
Side effects of dizziness blurred vision.tachycardia chest pain muscle weakness and parathesias.
Getting off it took about 6 months with rebound effects of jitters sweating tachycardia at  random.  It was no different than getting off heroin.
Twice while in public the side effects were so severe other people called an ambulance and I went to the ER.
This medication is lethal, at least for me.  I heard some people say they felt really good on it???  You don't know until you try a med how you will react.  I put it on my allergy list.
There is a light at the end of the tunnel when you are getting off it.  It takes time and should be done with medical supervision.  It took me 6 months to get over the rebound effects.
I feel like a drug addict that survived rehab and made it through!!!  Hang in there and God Bless!!!”",1
Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Beta Blocker Rebound.....the Docs will tell you that this metaprolol is out of your system in 3 days.  It may be out of your blood but it is not out of the nervous system for at least 3 months.
Thus.....there is no longer inhibition of norepinephrine which causes the elevated HR and the anxiety reaction.  It crosses the blood brain barrier and is lipophilic (stored in fat tissue) which stays in your system longer
Both myself and a friend of mine have weaned off this drug and we are still having mild Rebound symptoms with elevated HR shaky knees and sweating.
While taking the drug they side effects were very intense.  Dizzy racing heart muscle weakness exercise intolerance palpitations constipation flushing etc.
This is a horrible drug and I wouldn't give it to a dead dog!
Try to be patient with the rebound effects.  I was told it does eventually subside so you will fell normal again.
Hope and prayers for all getting off this drug!”","

My EP dr said increase to metoprolol to 1x 100mg, I told him my cardologist  suggested take two 50mg when my rate increased as needed. He said make an appointment to see cardologist that has known my condition for 2 monthss. Cardiologist said BP is not that high recommended no changes.

Cardiologist put me on Chlorothiladone since BP was running in mid 130’s /90. The first few days was fine then my eyes were always red and itchy, upset stomach, out of breath so much that I couldn’t even walk across the room, and terrible insomnia and horrible nightmares! Asked if I could reduce it to half. Three weeks later and nothing changed so weaning off by taking every other day for three weeks. This is horrible so now I know why my cardiologist wanted me on thiazide for a month to see if palpitations stopped after lowering BP. By the way, my BP is still the same. I don’t have insurance”","

Today is 07/12/2021 and I had to call my cardiologist and demand that I’m taken off of this. It gives me tremors, anxiety, chest pains, shortness of breath, my legs and arms turn weird colours, I am crying randomly for no reason, it makes me extremely intolerable to heat to the point where I had heat exhaustion so badly yesterday that I was almost rushed to the ER. It’s the scariest experience with a medication I’ve ever had and even though I’ve only been taking it for a few days I’m 150% more scared than ever to stop taking it because I’m afraid of what will happen if I do. I was on propranolol for almost a year before being prescribed metoprolol and I never had any issues with it. Metoprolol literally makes me feel like my life is finishing.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“Was on Toprol XR for only 6 weeks and had to get off of it quickly. HORRIBLE anxiety/panic attacks, constant arrhythmia, tachycardia, passing out, hypoglycemia, hallucinations, nightmares, Raynaud's syndrome, etc. This drug almost finished me off. I had 13 severe panic attacks since starting it; and if I wasn't as healthy a person as I am, I am certain it would have given me a heart attack. I am now exactly 8 weeks off of it. Most of the horrible symptoms have stopped, except the arrhythmia that comes and goes. In my opinion, Toprol is a serious endocrine disrupter and should be pulled from the market. It is a very dangerous drug. Can't believe how sick I became after starting it. Screw all pills. I can control my BP with diet. I truly regret ever putting one of these poisonous pills in my mouth.”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have not only super high blood pressure but also very high pulse & physical anxiety symptoms. It's idiopathic; I'm young, slim & female, with good diet & no aggravating lifestyle factors. I've been this way since age 18. Tried several solutions including OTC & prescription medications, diet changes & hippie-dippie placebo stuff like breathing exercises/meditation. Currently I'm on 3 meds for my BP. The only one I really miss when I skip it is metoprolol. If I skip my ACE inhibitor or my diuretic, there's barely any difference. Skip my metoprolol? I'd better call in sick.

You shouldn't give a hoot about my experience; my body chemistry has nothing to do with yours. Your body may not give a damn about beta blockers but care everything about a calcium channel blocker for all we know. All bodies are different, with a different reaction to different meds. I can't believe we're still reviewing medication like it's a one-size-fits-all deal that we can take each other's advice on.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Getting off this medication is brutal.
I only took it for 2 months and I was never sicker.
Side effects of dizziness blurred vision.tachycardia chest pain muscle weakness and parathesias.
Getting off it took about 6 months with rebound effects of jitters sweating tachycardia at  random.  It was no different than getting off heroin.
Twice while in public the side effects were so severe other people called an ambulance and I went to the ER.
This medication is lethal, at least for me.  I heard some people say they felt really good on it???  You don't know until you try a med how you will react.  I put it on my allergy list.
There is a light at the end of the tunnel when you are getting off it.  It takes time and should be done with medical supervision.  It took me 6 months to get over the rebound effects.
I feel like a drug addict that survived rehab and made it through!!!  Hang in there and God Bless!!!”",1
Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Beta Blocker Rebound.....the Docs will tell you that this metaprolol is out of your system in 3 days.  It may be out of your blood but it is not out of the nervous system for at least 3 months.
Thus.....there is no longer inhibition of norepinephrine which causes the elevated HR and the anxiety reaction.  It crosses the blood brain barrier and is lipophilic (stored in fat tissue) which stays in your system longer
Both myself and a friend of mine have weaned off this drug and we are still having mild Rebound symptoms with elevated HR shaky knees and sweating.
While taking the drug they side effects were very intense.  Dizzy racing heart muscle weakness exercise intolerance palpitations constipation flushing etc.
This is a horrible drug and I wouldn't give it to a dead dog!
Try to be patient with the rebound effects.  I was told it does eventually subside so you will fell normal again.
Hope and prayers for all getting off this drug!”","

I thought maybe by switching to the brand name I could fix it but after several months on it found out AstraZeneca doesn't even make it anymore so I was paying 6x as much for, basically, the generic rubbish. Finally, a wise cardiologist took me off the time release and put me on the 2x a day dosage of the tartrate and my blood pressure has been really good since then.

Was recently diagnosed with “stress induced” pvc/pac’s, symptomatic and pretty frequent but not enough to require any immediate treatment when I went to the ER. Thought it was anxiety then it persisted every couple minutes a swift kick to my chest, losing my breath, so I gave in after almost a day of relaxation techniques.  ER doc started me on metoprolol. Awful. They helped the symptoms but I felt like rubbish. Dizzy, tired, my vitals were fine but just that 10-15 point drop in my blood pressure was giving me headaches and dizziness affecting me! My resting HR was 50’s which was concerning at first but I was asymptomatic so no issue, gave me anxiety tho and made me restless at night. Started on 50mg, was only taking 25mg by the end of it after 2 weeks and was switched to propranolol. Much better after a couple days of that med, way less symptoms.”","

A couple years ago I had a 24 hr stay to evaluate HR of 165. All testing normal. No treatment. A year later back in ER with pulse of 250. I was given Adenosine to convert me and then given Metoprolol Succinate 25mg daily. I've been on it a year. I noticed some tiredness but nothing major. Over the next year my tiredness became debilitating and I suffered severe depression, insomnia, and panic attacks. I didn't make the connection and blamed it on the pandemic and all the isolation and restrictions everywhere. I thought I was just having a hard time coming. Then the drenching night and day sweats started.  Still I blamed it on perimenopause. But then came the heat and activity intolerance. Minimal activity caused me to become SOB , shake, and drenched in sweat. Sleep was non existent. I began having numbness in legs and feet.”","

BP under control but pulse seems too low anywhere from 40 to 60 on days of normal sinus rhythms. Makes me feel light headed and concerns me lately. I cut 50mg in half of Metoprolol that seems to do the trick where BP goes to 100 over 80 and pulse stays around 55 or 60 I hate that feeling when pulse is in the 40 s. If I don't take these meds my A-Fib starts up and plus can get up to 180 scary feeling. So yes it helps a lot, but I need to ask DR about decreasing dose of Metoprolol maybe.”",1

The side effects are becoming unbearable now though. I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half.

The longer I took the drug, the more side effects. at two months, my feet and legs developed tingling and numbness. Then, my fingers and hands developed the tingling. At three months of taking the drug, swallowing became very difficult. Food would get stuck in my throat and I would not be able to talk or dislodge food. Then, the insomnia started. I would wake at about 2 am and not be able to go back to sleep for several hours. Always tired, then would want to eat. I gained 20 pounds in a couple of months. When I would wake in the night because my arms would be asleep, that was the last straw. I stopped taking the drug and got a different prescription.”","

Almost stopped taking med but I continued into my 2nd week after my Dr told me to continue side effects would subside.

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I had two incidents of a-fib one year apart---almost to the day. After the first incident, doctor put me on eliquis and metoprolol and after a month of no a-fib incident, took me off and chalked it all up to unexplained incident of elevated heart rate. The second time, however, meant going on these two again---25 mg of metoprolol once a day--- for good. I can understand the eliquis requirement, but am just not sure of metoprolol. While I am not putting on a lot of weight, as an athletic 59 year old, I know I am not losing anything either, and certainly feel my metabolism has been slowed.
Point is, a-fib is said to be an affliction many have and one that oftentimes has no explanation. I'm ok with lessening my risk of stroke via eliquis, but wonder about this drug. And naturally, I worry about taking myself off of it completely.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“My father (age 93) was prescribed metoprolol after getting a pacemaker due to fainting episodes. He discontinued lisinopril six months ago. His blood pressure was never high and was always on the low side. 
   A couple of years ago, his walking strength and balance started to decline, with a quick decline in the last three months. He also started to have short term memory problems in the last few months. His blood pressure has sometimes been 85:55 or 100:60 - rather low. 
   Another symptom has been needing to get up about 7 times at night, and then feeling fatigue and falling asleep during the day quite a bit. He started melatonin about a month ago to encourage normal sleep but it didn't seem to change the pattern. When he discontinued metoprolol five days ago, there was an immediate change. He has been sleeping through the night, not getting up at all - which he hasn't experienced for months. He also isn't nodding off constantly during the day.”","

Best to see a MD that takes a more holistic approach instead of pushing pill.  Drug reps give kick backs to doctors for pushing their medications.  Lobster dinners etc.  I know I went to some of the dinners,  It is a crime that pills are prescribed for so many people with side effects that can kill you or destroy your liver or pancreas.

Sometimes I take it 2x's a day if my PVC's act up. The PVC's are really scary but this combination of medicine does help them. When I first started getting them, I had to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours and I also had an echocardiogram of my heart. My doctor told me these things are benign. They don't feel benign though when it feels like my heart's gonna stop and I'm gonna drop dead. I gave this medicine a 7 out of 10 because while it does work, I need the combination of these 2 medications to really notice a difference. I'd just like to add that I am a 38-year-old female.

was prescribed Atenolol and it helped for about 6 hours. When it wore off they were bad. Dr. prescribed metoprolol succinate as it is an extended release beta blocker.

This medication works very well for me.

people claim beta blockers don't stop the PVC themselves rather the beta blockers simply numb the sensation

For me this is not the case.

It actually stops them.

I take 25mg.  If I have a bad day I take an extra half.

When my Endo put me on propranolol for the fast heart rate hyperthyroidism gives I was relieved! But once my thyroid was in normal range I asked to be taken off due to it making my already lower BP, very low. So, I got off and I noticed I still had fast HR and ignored it since this is something I was used to since I was a teen.. I finally got tired and pushed for answers since my Endo was concerned it would eventually cause heart damage working too hard.. so I of course freaked out.. I was diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and put on metoprolol and 5 months in on half of 25 mgs I’m very short of breath since Christmas (NOT COVID), dizzy, beyond a normal tired, extremely cold, lack of drive”","

I did have increased depression, but my thyroid levels were low as well.  With regular exercise, the depression seems to have subsided.

I thought I was developing IBS, then I read an IBS article about a woman who had the same symptoms as I. When she got off Metoprolol, the ""IBS"" stopped! I could only eat rice. Lost a ton of weight, but it wasn't worth it. Now, I have finally weaned off of it and my digestive tract is quiet, returning to normal.Please be careful when taking it.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“My doctor had me on metoprolol for approximately 6 years. Did great for lowering my blood pressure which was very high. They have now taken me off of it because my pulse rate was in the high 30s to low 40s. I now wonder if I should have stayed on it because they have been working for over 8 months trying to get my blood pressure under control. They finally had me wear a heart monitor and I found out that I have a heart arrhythmia. This is one of the pills they will probably want to put me back on and I can't take it because of the low pulse rate. Damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't”,"

After 2 weeks of taking this form of Metoprolol,  I began getting hallucinations.   I started seeing my bed's blankets moving up and down as if the bed was breathing.   I watched the walls start moving as they, too, were breathing.   The only thing different in my life was the change in medication.   I immediately stopped taking it and went back to using the Tartrate form, which I still had.   I told my primary physician about my experience and she laughed it off.”","

Everyone warned me about how tired I was going to be since this medication would literally be slowing my heart down but I've never experienced that. I don't sleep much and have insomnia so that could be why. 
I also have experienced crazy dreams and I sleep walk from time to time. I've always had dreams and talked in my sleep but I think the medication makes it a little worse especially if you're taking it closer to bed time. 
I do get a little light headed if I stand up quick and bend down but it's not bad. 
The benefit I get from this medication outweighs any of these insignificant side effects. I would recommend to push through any side effects and let the medication adapt to you!”","

I called my doctor and she wanted to give me a medicine that has worse side effects to  help to bring the blood sugar down. I refused to take it.  I am now in the process of doing research to prove my point. It is not my diet that is causing my sugar to stay high it is the raised dosage of metoprolol. I think I may have to fight with my doctor about this, but I see no reason to take more meds to counteract the side effects caused by a med I am already on. I think that med should be changed.”","

Otherwise I only drink decaffeinated beverages the other parts of the day. Just that one boost of caffeine in the afternoon will offset the sleepiness of the metoprolol. I'm a 46 year old female that smokes.”","

Metoprolol,For Premature Ventricular Depolarizations:,“I took metaprolol for 27 years with no problems that controlled my PVCs and worked wonderfully. Inderal made it worse so different people might need different medications to control them. I had no side effects. I wouldn't hesitate to use it again. I don't use it anymore as I got a cardiac ablation that stopped my arrythmias permanently.”,"

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“Had a ruptured brain aneurysm 3 years ago. Been in metoprolol Succinate 25 mg. ever since. Not one problem. I’m shocked at the issues I’m reading about with this. It’s been fine for controlling my BP.”,"

Heart rate now around 60-70, blood PSI 120/70 side effects so far include problems sleeping, restlessness also drowsy on and off. Only been taking this drug for a week now, perhaps the side effects will reduce in time.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol):,“I was given an presription for Toprol Xl by my doctor a years ago for an arrhythmia and some elevated blood pressure. About 6 months later my insurance said I should take  metoprolol instead of Toprol-XL because of the cost - what a horrible experience - the problem was I didn't know it was the metoprolol that was basically  making me worse.  My pulse dropped below 50 - my ankles and legs swelled up - I was short of breath - still had an arrhythmia - finally about about 6 months I asked my pharmacist which of my medicines was causing my heart rate to be so low - he pointed to the metoprolol - needless to say I went back on the Toprol Xl brand only and I am good - I get angry when I think how I suffered for over 6 months while taking that garbage generic.....”,"

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“My tachycardia started in my middle 30s, and though they were rare, became more severe as i entered my middle 40's and had to ER visits requiring the injection that stops the heart-no fun and scary. After this I went to a cardiologist who gave me 50 mg Metoprolol to take as needed. I am happy that i don't have to take it daily because it does make me sluggish on the very rare times that I do-I am pleased to have a solution when these events happen and my fears of dying suddenly from a heart episode have been drastically reduced.”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg BID for 10 years. Experiences are: Heart does not always rest long enough between beats, lack of sleep,
memory loss, headaches, white pimple in mouth (just started a month ago), running nose, tiredness, low energy, constipation, shortness of breathe while resting, hypertension and aching feet.
I will be 77 a few days from now.  Found an OTC that can replace
this drug, but must go off very slowly.  All in all, this drug is now too strong for me as I will be talking with my heart doctor very soon.”","

Metoprolol,For Heart Attack:,"“HA with one stent in LAD and was prescribed Metoprolol and Brilinta.  A week later the side effects all kicked in: shooting chest pains, racing heart, chest/arms/legs tingling, jitteriness and anxiety.  I felt like I was having another HA so spent the weekend in the ER where they didn't find anything wrong. My GP prescribed anxiety meds which provided some helped a bit.  After a month of complaining to my cardiologist, they finally took me off of metoprolol and the anxiety, jitters and racing heart rate went away.

I was still getting chest pains, shortness of breath, and was feeling nauseous.  Another month and I convinced my Dr to switch from Brilinta to Effient and the remaining side effects went away.

I'm finally starting to feel normal.  Not all Drs are open to modifying patients meds which can be a real issue if you are experiencing negative side effects so please advocate for yourself.”",1
Metoprolol,Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):,"“I’ve had Graves’ disease since I was 14, so my cardiologist and endocrinologist thinks that that’s where my severe SVT symptoms came from.

I still have strange flutters and what feels like bubbling sometimes. I don’t know what to do about it, but I take this to control the extremely fast heart rate”","

After a pulmonary embolism (no symptoms except PVCs), I suffered PVC w/anxiety and panic attacks, even while treating blood clots with Coumadin. I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped  immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly. I developed symptoms of asthma and chest tightness + fatigue. I was switched to Diltiazem. After 8 days of body adjustment (w/small amt Ativan 2 days), I again feel human.”","

Zero side effects for me at least. I have been on Lopressor for 30 years.  I have tried numerous other medications to control my arrhythmia, but Metroprolol is the best.

I have been on metoprolol 25 mg, once a day in the morning, for the past 18 months and I love it. I was originally put on it twice a day, but I already had bradycardia and low blood pressure at night so within a couple of days the nighttime dose was making me wake up gasping for air with an extremely low heart rate and blood pressure so low it wouldn't register on my home monitor.  I called the doctor and he said to not take the bedtime dose. I haven't had any side effects that I recall.

For the first six years I had great results with 25 mg at night but gradually I had breakthrough tachycardia so my cardiologist added 25mg in the morning and my heart rate is again in the normal range with my resting heart rate being around 68.

I have been dealing with Supraventricular Tachycardia my whole life, and at 49 it finally came to this point. Since starting the metoprolol, I have had heart flutters every day, all throughout the day, as well as some chest tightness, which I previously have not had. It also caused sun sensitivity and increased/extreme sweating. Although I have not had another serious attack, the side effects way outweigh any benefit for me. I decided to stop taking the metoprolol, and the heart flutter has greatly decreased, as well as the sweating. Next step for me is an ablation.”","

I was placed on Imitrex and it appeared to be working to quickly relieve migraines but did not last.  Over time my blood pressure began to raise and Imitrex can cause it.
My cardiologist put me on Metoprolol Succinate ER 25 mg for my blood pressure and what do you know!  I can think clearer and migraines All gone!  God is truly Good!  
I have less anxiety, blood pressure down, & migraines gone!  I forgot to mention that I really do not like to take medicines.  I prefer the natural route.  But this medicine was worth taking!”","

But doctor has since increased it to 50 mg to help lower bp. In addition to high bp, I have Sleep Apnea. I've gone to have an EGD under general anesthesia 2x now and they are cancelled because my bp is too high and a high risk. My Primary Care Doc is really after me to use the CPCP for Sleep Apnea. I  never use it for more than a few days or so. I don't like it and will not commit to long term use. Since increasing the Toprol, I have been feeling more lightheaded and my eyesight seems mildly shaky and I feel a little more hopeless lately.

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“No, not getting paid for this. First, I suffered from vicious migraine attacks since I was about 7. Migraine so severe that NOTHING would work. Finally in 2010 when I was 38 I needed stents to fix major coranary blockages. I never had a migraine since..and I used to have them about twice per week. Some have even lasted more than a week! I figure, after reading it MUST be the metoprolol...it's been 6 years. Migraine FREE. At the very least, you should try it and see for yourself..or continue suffering.”","

Felt like I had an ace bandage wrapped around my chest. 
My BP was only 140/80 before. After was about 128/65. I’ve been exercising for 14years. 
Side effects outweighed the benefit. I switched to bystolic today ($120/90 day supply). Wish me luck.

So, within 2 weeks I had another bout of tachycardia and went to the ER again. This time I was put on metropolol and still not taken off of hydrochlorothyazide. Instead of tachycardia I ended up within 2 weeks with arrhythmia that was so bad it felt as if my heart was going to explode through my chest. I kept having bouts of arrhythmia every 2 weeks with my heart exploding with every heartbeat. I used a food protocol changed everything. D-ribose does the same as metropolol with no side effects.”","

I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute.  The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation.  That was over a year ago.  We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.”","

I felt very tired to the point of falling asleep during the day, was worn out if I walked to far or even stood too long, felt lightheadedness, nauseated, was afraid to drive. I'm glad I stuck it out, the side effects finally abated. Hang in there, the bad side effects can go away. For the record I'm a 69 year old woman, 5`4"" 128 lbs. I take the pill at night.”","

My BP is very high in the morning, like 167/110, before I take my daily dosage of valsartan. Within 2 hours of taking it my BP hasn't improved, then at about 5 hours after I take my BP med my BP plummets to like 71/54, sometimes lower.

About two months ago, my palpitations became more consistent my heart would beat of my chest uncontrollably out of nowhere I constantly felt like I was going to faint. I went to the ER a few days ago because I was having another episode and couldn’t take it anymore. They were able to catch it all and the cardiologist decided to put me on a low dose of metoprolol. So far it hasn’t been too bad, it has especially given me relief with the tachycardia I still feel the PVC’s but they are not as constant and severe. Only concerns I have are I feel very short of breath at times, and I literally can’t sleep at night anymore. I’m hoping it gets better.”","
7 "
Metoprolol,For Premature Ventricular Depolarizations:,"“I have PACs and PVCs mostly related to stress and anxiety. Nothing that was overly concerning. I was medicated because the feeling of the PVCs was interfering with my quality of life. Between metprolol, antidepressants and prn ativan, I gained 40lbs in 1.5  yrs.   I got more depressed.   I was exercising too. I stopped  all meds  and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/  no sugar etc.   Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months.  It also causes depression and weight gain as a side effect.  However it  is effective in treating many other conditions. I do not condone stopping medications without consulting your physician.”","

I felt like everything in my life was out of control even though mentally I knew it wasn't. I was sobbing hysterically all day and felt like I was losing my mind! I figured out the only change I'd made was taking metoprolol so I weaned myself off of it and the depression cleared right up. My doctor said he has a lot of patients on this medication and even though depression is a side effect none of them have had this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a common side effect but beware if you're just starting this.”","

I had suffered severe chest pain for two hours before going to the ER, which was stupid of me.

I have been on Metoprolol Tartrate for 2.5 years now. 25 mg. twice daily. It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.

I have been only taking 100-150 mg. I break to be 100 mg pill in half and take 50 mg every six hours. My blood pressure went from 197/130 to approx 147/97.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I am 53, and I've felt palpitations since my 20's. however, they weren't bad at all nor frequent. but last year, they suddenly became very bad, more frequent, more severe, I'd have them all day long, horrendous.
So I was put on beta blockers. First propranolol, which worked really well, but made me feel exhausted. I was switched to metoprolol whilst in hospital
On the metoprolol, you feel nauseous sometimes, but if you take cyclizine, it helps. But metoprolol doesn't make me feel as tired as the propranolol, you feel more normal on metoprolol. 
I haven't really noticed any other side effect symptoms,
but one thing I also liked about propranolol is that it seemed to really help with anxiety symptoms as I wasn't having them as much.
On the metoprolol, because it works differently it does not help with anxiety,
and the frustrating thing is that even on beta blockers, I still get palpitations, just not as frequent as before taking them.”","

I was extremely fatigued and I started noticing weight gain.  That weight gain has been is now 18 pounds in the 5 months following the ablation. Now, none of my clothes fit. I have told my doctor about the weight gain, but he did not seem concerned. I am concerned. Has anyone else had this and were you able to do something about it?

Dr. said thyroid med needed adjusting. 2 months ago while awaiting diagnostics, he put me on 25mg Metoprolol. It lowered heart rate & BP, BUT week #1 of this med was awful. I was nauseous & tired. By week 3 nausea had subsided somewhat but my eyes became unbearably itchy. I also thought I was having heartburn but that evolved into episodes of burning chest pains. A few nights I considered going to the ER because I feared a heart attack. It was hard to get to sleep & stay sleep. I am used to regular workouts but had low energy. I skipped a day’s dose yesterday and feel incredibly better already. I have an appointment with my cardiologist in 2 days. I am going to be adamant about an explanation  and modification to my med regimen! I have never had a med make me feel this sick. It managed my heart rate & BP well but the intense side effects are not worth it. I wasn’t able to function normally.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Initially received this at Urgent Care because I couldn't get into my doctor when my blood pressure was high at a employer mandated check.  I was on it 3 weeks, 2 pills a day at 25 mg each. It brought the BP down by about 20 points.  The side effects were cold feet mid morning, trouble sleeping, and the dosage did not last a full 12 hours.  I could feel the heart slow down at about 1 hour after medicating and then start to speed up again at about 9 hours.  I had to be careful not to take it close to bedtime because it made me feel hyper about 2-3 hours after the dose.  Upon reflection, these side effects were less than some of the other stuff I've taken since.”","

It contributed to giving me stroke like symptoms which were then preceded by Parkinson's disease symptoms. Tardive dyskinesia. Dystonia. I can no longer function, it has made my blood sugar uncontrollable and completely ruined my GI. It never helped with my heart palpitations but cardiologist said to stay on it and it would get better. But it just kept getting worse. Worsened heart disease and breathing.

It felt like my heart was stopping altogether. I'm a fit 27 year old with low BP and resting heart rate. Because of this, I have to question the doctor's judgement in prescribing this medication. It brought my BP and heart rate down even further, severely affecting my quality of life. I was constantly lightheaded, foggy, woke up with headaches, etc. Bad decision on his part. Switched to flecainide and feel like myself again!”","

I complained to my doctor about the swelling, and he said I had damaged vein valves in my legs.   After seeing him, the swelling gradually grew worse.  One leg was enormous.  I started looking up adverse reactions on-line to see what could be causing this problem.  The only one that I take regularly is Metoprolol.  I stopped taking it immediately, and the swelling has been subsiding until my legs look also normal again.

I had a minor last week and once I took a half of an Amerge, it was gone immediately. I did though develop strange dreams which I have read reviews about. However, they are tolerable.

If you're having side effects, give this medication a couple months to work. It will get better. Make sure your doctor monitors your triglycerides and blood sugar while on any beta blocker.

A lot of people here report feeling tired, but I don't feel that way at all. I take the pill at night. Maybe that side effect wears off as I sleep?

I've been on pain pill, Tramadol, muscle relaxer, Skelaxin, and Zofran for nausea, and ice packs and heat to my neck.  Nothing working!   I took my first Metoprolol 50mg this morning and my headache is gone!  No side effects from the metoprolol.   I consider it my miracle drug.

I'm a cardiac nurse and hand out metoprolol all day for cardiac conditions.  Who knew it was for migraine/headaches?!.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“I am a 28 year old healthy female. I was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia just recently and was put on Toprol XL 25 mg. I have only had a few minor attacks since being on this medication however I have side effects - Constantly exhausted and don't feel like myself and I have a heavy feeling in my chest which is extremely uncomfortable.  Side effects have not subsided much since I started the medication 5 weeks ago. The side effects are bad enough to where I'm tempted to stop taking it and take my chances with the SVT! My doctor is recommending ablation procedure in hopes of that solving my problem and get me off the medication.”,"

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“(To treat Tachycardia the medicine does a great job at lower heart rate to Normal levels. I would rate it a 10.) 

To rate the medicine due to the side effects causes lack of sex drive and as it makes anxiety, depression and causes you to feel tired like there's no tomorrow. Even if you sleep 18 hrs out of the day it still doesn't feel like enough I would rate it a 1 at best) 


I have been on this medication for going on 7 yrs.  I was started out on a low dose and now I'm up to 100mg 2x a day.  Now the problem with this medication is it makes you want to sleep constantly and if you have issues like anxiety or depression it makes it worse with high dosages.”","

Metoprolol,For Heart Failure:,"“So I've been on metoprolol for over a year. Not knowing until very recently that this medicine has been giving me horrible side effects the entire time. Within the last 6 months those side effects worsened to the point of dropping my BP so low that I felt dumb or slow, confused, couldn't think straight, almost in a dream like daze. Problems sleeping, anxiety went through the roof, panic attacks multiple times a day, pain in my chest, pain in my arm, short of breath laying down, just all the way around feeling OFF. Would give this medicine 0/10 also I only take 25mg and this medicine seems to very dramatically affect me when I mess with the dosing. Also it has been dropping my BP to 80/60 an when that happens is when all of the symptoms get exaggerated”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking Metoprolol one month ago and everything was going good until a couple of weeks ago. I started having vivid dreams, insomnia, numbness in the extremities, tingling and burning on my face and legs. I called my provider and he wanted me to come in to get a blood pressure check because of the numbness in my left hand. My blood pressure was within normal range and so was my pulse. My provider decided to keep me on the medication because it was lowering my bp and pulse. I go back in two weeks, but I’m going to recommend he prescribe me something else. Help”","

At this exam I weighed 222. I came back in a month and was up to 233. No change in diet exercise routine, or anything. Came back a month later. She weighed me again and I was up
to 238. BP was hardly changed: 155/98. She decided to take me off and get me started on a diuretic.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Prescribed this for heart palpitations/tachycardia associated with extreme anxiety and panic attacks. Also had rather elevated blood pressure which I think runs in the family. Felt awful for weeks prior to being prescribed the medication, but once I started taking it things improved VERY quickly. Resting heart rate and blood pressure both down, no more palpitations, far less health anxiety. Doctor described it as having a ""calming effect"" and I definitely agree. No side effects to speak of thus far about 2 months in. 90mg immediate release once per day.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I began taking metoprolol about 2 months ago, 25 mg daily.  I had a hard time getting used to it. Stupidly, I stopped taking it after the first week, I ended up feeling so bad I had to go to the ER.  Since then all my problems have been side-effects.  A few hours before I am to take my next dose I begin to feel depressed, very cranky and angry and generally just awful.  Once I take the medicine though those feelings tend to go away.  It also upsets my stomach and I have had a mild loss of appetite.  I have also noticed that some foods taste different.  I am also having a problem staying asleep, but I seem to fall asleep easily.  So I am up and down all night.  I am not happy on it so I will be asking my doctor for something else.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I have Atrial fibrillation, inherited it from my mother. I'm 62 now, and VA put me on Warfarin and Metropolol about 6 weeks ago. Seems to be doing the trick and only side effect I notice is that if I drink a small glass of red wine, I'll get a headache in the middle of the night. Used to take Advil to shake them but can't now and Tylenol does nothing. Tried some beer and no headache. My one vice is my nightly glass of wine, which looks like I'll have to give up and replace with beer once in a while. Oh well, beats the alternative. No other side effects yet. Have had trouble losing any weight but I attribute that to the state they have me on. Ain't it great growin old?”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I have taken metoprolol 50 mg daily for about 6 years. I have not experienced any recurrences of very unpleasant prolonged bouts of tachycardia. The only negative side effect has been a slight decrease in energy and some weight increase, probably due to the lower activity.  This seems to be an effective medication for me.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“While the drug did the job of calming my heart when it would race or jump when I would exercise, it had brutal and extremely dangerous psychological side effects. This drug was so hard on me by magnifying extreme emotions that I was experiencing, and I had no idea until in a fluke experiment I stopped taking it for 48 hours to see what would happen. My extreme psychological anxiety and hopelessness and psychosis nearly disappeared with the extreme symptoms almost evaporating at 75% dissipation. This is a very dangerous and scary drug.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“This is an update to a post I made in October 2021..
I discontinued Toprol due to nasty side effects after only 2 months use (severe anxiety, panic attacks, severe depression, insomnia, swelling of extremities, bloat/gassy, blurred vision, icy hands/feet, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, chest vibrations)
Its been 1 year and 3 months since discontinuation. I am STILL experiencing off and on arrhythmia. I've had thorough exam and testing with 30 day monitoring from 2 different cardiologists. My heart is very healthy, no blockages, no disease. Neither cardiologist can find any reason for the persistent arrhythmia, nor will they believe me when I tell them I think the Toprol caused this long term persistent arrhythmia. I've also had extensive endocrinology testing and nothing is coming up as a reason for this arrhythmia. 
NOTE: I've never in my entire life had any heart arrhythmia or palps  UNTIL I took Toprol, and now its a regular occurrence. This cannot be a coincidence.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Actually raised my heart rate from 70s to mid 80s to 100+ and did nothing for my blood pressure. Also gave me side effect of flashing lights at night in left eye. Wound up in ER after taking this drug for 3 months and LOST 14 pounds. Dr. Said impossible that this was due to metopropol, but as soon as I changed to Bystolic, heart rate decreased to 60s and 70s and weight stopped dropping. Guess I was allergic to it.”","

Before the medicines I used to have a headache from the back of my neck to the back of my head every day. Since taking it, no more headaches. Blood pressure is low too. Can't seem to lose any weight though. I think I started out at 185 lbs (still overweight), but now I'm at 192 lbs and can't seem to get below that. Am pretty gassy and have frequent diarrhea.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I’ve been on Metoprolol for about a month now and I was admitted to hospital for heart palpations and waiting surgery now for SVT. Metoprolol causes severe side effects of headaches, lightheadedness and dizziness. The medicine does a great job in lowering heart rate but side effects are unreal.

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“The day after I started using metoprolol I began having side effects. First it was nausea and loss of appetite, then wanting to sleep in the daytime (I never do this), no energy at all, couldn't accomplish anything, anxiety, and felt this way for 3 weeks before it dawned on me it might be the change in blood pressure meds. When I looked up side effects of this drug I knew it was not for me. I am back on Atenolol which had been discontinued manufacturing and already feeling better. Wondering how long the effects of metoprolol will be in my system. I'm glad it works for some, but for me it was like poison.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“My husband has been on Toprol XL for over a year. Started on 100mg for very high BP. Also on Atacand 4mg for mild left heart Failure. Now reduced to 50 mg alternate days. Side effects, Severe Peyronie's disease and loss of libido. Fullness in stomach and loss of appetite. Various aches and pains, swelling in hands and others random areas. Seems to get a rebound effect of breathlessness or its just a side effect. BP is  good in low 120/65. May try cutting in half to 25mg a day. Dr prescribed a different Beta Blocker that has worse side effects so he hasn't filled that out. Also its only available as Generic which from his experience with Metaprolol it was worse. He gets the brand Drugs through Canada.”","

Since that time my BP has stayed around 115-125/60 something/low 70s. My resting heart rate varies from high 40s to low 60s/min. I also started swimming laps which is off and on again. The medicine seems to work well for me without any noticeable side effects at all.

Both my mom and dad had high blood pressure. I'm now in my mid fifties so I guess it's my turn now.”",1
Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Terrible and outright dangerous. This is a generic that is made by different pharma companies using whatever fillers and coating they get at the lowest possible price from goodness knows where; quality varies from one to the other, and from refill to refill; caused the opposite effects - NOT lowering BP - rather increasing it sky high! 
My pharmacist told me that many patients complain about it and gave me the brand (Toprol) to try - very different results!! Only complaint now is tiredness, bit wobbly, and some pressure and shortness of breath after taking it;
I take 25 mg. And break it in half, and take each half 6-7 hours apart, which was my pharmacists recommendation, and it’s better. Stay away from the generic, consult your pharmacist, and be well!”","

Metoprolol,Lopressor (metoprolol) for Angina:,"“I have Angina and over the past year began a regime of Bayer (or Bufferin) starting at 500mg every morning. Things got a little worse after six months and I upped my dosage to 1000mg per day. This was all self medication without medical consult (I knew what the problem was). Finally even the 1000mg a day wasn't working and I went to see the doctor. He put me on 50mg of Lopressor per day and things turned around within 2 days. The pain is gone and I can get a whole nights sleep without waking up in the middle of the morning (usually 3-4am, when the incidence of heart attack is the highest statistically) in major pain. So far so good. If you have Angina then DO see a doctor. Get the tests! After all, it's really your life your dealing with.”","

I was switched to 100mg once a day. This med caused me to be quite tired/fatigued. In the beginning I was also dizzy but that eventually went away almost completely. The sleepiness has not gone away but it's manageable. The good it does for my heart outweighs the side effects for me.”,"

At 57  at that time I was very healthy, exercising regularly and eating well  and taking my good health for granted,  needless to say because of the stress I was under my blood pressure was very way up which was very unusual and I was suffering from PVCs. I was prescribed  10 mg  lisinipril and 25 mg Metroprol. As I continued  to grieve, exercise and eat well,  and take the medication as prescribed my blood pressure became normal and PVC disappeared. I went off Lisinopril  a year later...I’m 61 now and I’m experiencing some different stress and PVC back with blood pressure normal.  I’m bit scared.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Started taking metoprolol 8 years ago when I was hospitalized with a bout of of tachycardia that wouldn't go away for hours. Diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. Started out at 50mg, but had breakthroughs regularly, and went up to 100mg after a year. The medication works great to keep my heart rate and blood pressure down to normal levels, however, for the first month on the medication I constantly fell asleep during daily activity, and even now I maintain a sense of perpetual fatigue. Hard to lose weight, and depression creeps up often. Brain fog has slowed my ability to focus and react swiftly, which is frustrating. Still, the medication works so well to keep the heart episodes at bay that I haven't tried switching to a new medication.”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on the extended release for 2 months, 25 mg once a day. I love it! I had a blood pressure crisis with non-stop dizziness and BP was 200/100, which happened a week after recovering from COVID. My general doctor put me on this because I also have low potassium (“hypokalemia”) and a diuretic would make it go even lower. I was already on an ace inhibitor when this happened. The metoprolol dropped my heart rate to about 58, but gradually it has come back up a little to 68 now. I like it because it makes me feel really calm. I haven’t had any of the negative side effects except a little dizziness when getting up quickly. I didn’t gain weight or feel tired, which I was afraid would happen. It just makes me feel very relaxed all over, in a physical way which carries over to also feeling good mentally. 10/10”","

Metoprolol,For Angina:,"“I am 54 and had a stent put in with 95% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 25mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body. Very tough emotionally, but adjusting.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have had many problems (one being that it took me a lot of time for my body to get used to it) with this product. The worst side effect has been the onset of diabetes which this product is responsible for.  The question I had of my cardiologist is why in the world would he prescribe it to a high risk candidate like me -- I am Hispanic, in my 50s when it was prescribed.  I informed my PA of this after my last crisis and she is looking into prescribing a different product (one given at the hospital) but this after a few years on Toprol.  I figure that without the change from this medicine I don't stand a chance of reversing my diabetic condition.”","

Seems like the doctor care more about my heart rate (that is Lower than before so is working), but my blood pressure is ever the same, especially the night time is ever 8 around 85/140 (sometimes 150 or 160). I told this many times but he still thinking about the BPM..so at the end the BPM decrease but not the blood pressure so is working 50/50.

Metoprolol,For Benign Essential Tremor:,"“This medication has helped my tremors immensely. Before, I was afraid to walk down a flight of stairs.

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):,"“I have been taking 40mg telmisartan at night for HBP. I also take a baby aspirin and a statin for coronary artery disease and 10mg omeprazole for Barretts.  I began experiencing frequent PVC's and my blood pressure was still too high, so my cardiologist added 25mg metoprolol tartrate in the morning. He subsequently added a half tablet of Metoprolol at night. Which helped the HBP but did not completely end the arrhythmia. 

Over 30 years ago, I was diagnosed with a chronic form of adult asthma. In 2018, a pulmonary specialist replaced Symbicort (two puffs twice a day ) with generic Singular, which I also stopped taking. However, for the past month I have been experiencing a wheezing cough, runny nose and tightness in my chest suggesting my asthma is active. Will be checking with my cardiologist and pulmonary specialist to see if the metoprolol should be replaced since the arrhythmia has returned and use of a beta-blocker may be contraindicated for asthma patients.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on some form of metoprolol for seven years. It was actually my first prescribed medication at 28. I never even thought about side effects as being the problems I was experiencing; thought there was always something else that the Doctor's was overlooking. Now that I have read these comments, I suffer from most of the common ones; tiredness, weakness, trouble losing weight, strange dreams, increased sweating, difficulty breathing, etc. Have had numerous tests off and on for the last two years, and nothing is ever found. I have also since then started taking clonidine and amlodipine. Some of these symptoms are probably drug interactions. I noticed a chaotic heartbeat when clonidine was added to the medicines. It has gotten worse for the past two years.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“With the start of my diagnosis with afib 3 1/2 years ago, I was started on 12.5 mg of metoprolol.  From the beginning, I seemed to have been made sicker, e.g. less energy and seemingly more afib.

Metoprolol worked against my prostate meds.  Had TURP.  TURP gave me CHF.  While in hospital, a very old fashioned heart doctor got me up to 250 mg/day.  Lots of its side effects.  Stopped it and went to ER.  Went on Coreg.  Gave me swelled legs.  Back on low dose of metoprolol.

Over time, up to 75 mg of metoprolol.  Afib stopped mostly with ICD & 2 ablations.  Last straw was numbness in feet and back shooting nerve pain.

On carvedilol now and no feet numbness nor back shooting nerve pain.  Best I've felt in 3 1/2 years.  Only 12.5 mg bid.”","

I had 2 SVT attacks within 60 or so days of each other.... and, again, if anything the lopressor probably did its best to prevent them... but it can't do everything. In short, this drug has been around a long time, and is a time-tested Beta Blocker.”",1

The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Reading the mixed reviews here, the first thing that jumped out was people have problems swallowing.  This has happened to me quite a bit recently, using metroprolol succ ER 25 mg daily, for about 2 years now.  I did have great success in reducing my pulse (130 resting pulse for 20 years, adjust to 90 now).  Overall I was happy with it, but now somewhat concerned with long term use.”","

That was on Metoprolol 25 mg twice day doc increased dosage to 50 mg twice day and now my heart rate is staying round 75-78 bpm resting. It works well. I love it. I've been on it for years and it has always controlled my blood pressure.”,"

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I am on 50mg about 6 months now It took two weeks for me to adjust to the meds. I have had to make serious life changes no more smoking and drinking I can't eat food with high salt contents because I've notice my heart rate increases and I have irregular heart rate very uncomfortable, and I watch my sugar intake.  I  exercise on a regular basis if I don't work out I just keep busy move around go for a simple walk. The only issue I have is at times my heart rate is low anywhere from 52-56 bpm when I'm laying down or even sometimes when I go shopping. I notice I have like a bit off lightheadedness dizzy not sure but not all the time. The medication works as long as I'm not doing the things that trigger AFib.”",1
Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for Mitral Valve Prolapse:,"“I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse syndrome my senior year in college, resulting in a medical discharge from the Army rather than commissioning as an officer. I was blacking out, fainting, and my activity tolerance dropped dramatically as the condition progressed. 

Metoprolol was prescribed for me to help regulate my heart rate - it worked great for that. I didn't feel the palpitations and heart racing with minimal activity. Downside was that my blood pressure was already low - so being on this medication made my blood pressure drop even lower. Doctors eventually put me on MIDODRINE which constricts my blood vessels causing an increase in blood pressure. The combination works great!”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“16 year old daughter rushed to local ER complaining of supraventricular tachycardia with heart rate of 283 - three attempts to cardiovert failed.

Daughter is experiencing moderate tiredness.”,1

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I had slight headache on back of head and neck  which bothered me.  I thought it was sweets or diet drink or my diet. Then after a month I went to see a dr. and her nurse was taking my blood pressure and it hurt real bad and I told her, she looked and took it again. She turned so I could my numbers and I was shocked the top number was 209.  I don't remember what the bottom number was. I called the dr. that had prescribed the metoprolol and he told me to get off it. It took 3-4 days for it to back to normal. I do take a blood thinner,I guess that will have to do?”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“I took toporol er and my blood pressure went up instead of down after 6 hours it was 180/105. Pharmacist said it was an adverse reaction. I had the same issue with propranolol 5 years ago. They are both beta blockers. Didn’t work for me.”,"

Feeling very good.”,"

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for Mitral Valve Prolapse:,“Just put 2 and 2 together after reading side effects and realize that the Toprol XL was causing my rapid weight gain and severely swollen ankles.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I first had SVT when I was 13 but undiagnosed until 18. I had episodes that lasted 1-36 hours. Episodes occurred 1-5 times/month. Average BPM was 190 and upon reaching 235  BPM I would start to loose consciousness. I tried all varieties of maneuvers to trigger the SVT to stop but none worked. If it laster longer than an hour I was transported to the ER where I was given Adenosine to restart my heart. I was given an Rx for Metoprlol Tartrate a few months before my first ablation when I was 20. I was started on 25mg/day. 9 days after my ablation, I had more episodes and was bumped up to 50mg, 100mg, then 150mg/day before my second ablation when I was 21. Had it been unsuccessful, I'd have been switched to an Ace-inhibitor.”","

Heart rate increases, I can feel my blood pressure increase to the point of feeling my pulse in my fingertips for example. I know it is either 7:00 am or 7:00 pm. These are the times I take this drug. 30 minutes later all is well. Thanks doctor.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Supraventricular Tachy with Arrhythmia runs in our family. When I was 6 years old a Doctor yelled heart attack, I thought he was having one and he thought I was having one. The nurse calmed him down. I obviously compensated from having it so long. So, that was how it was till I was about 28. Then my heart rate was 180 a minute all the time. I could not compensate. I was told to go on heart medicines. I am allergic to a lot of things and do not respond well to things. So after about dying from trying beta blockers I was put on Corgard which worked perfect. Now my insurance will not cover it. I am 56 and just put on Metoprolol and scared. I hope it works well and I have no problems.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“4 years ago i had my first Afib 200 heart beat.   they keeped me over night with IV in me and slowed the heart down to about 120   sometime over night it reset its self.

I take Metoprolol  twice a day.  Morning and Night.   and the Doc said if needed take 1 more.

when I first was taken Metoprolol I got tired.  and it took a few weeks to get over that feeling.    But now I don't get tired.  My heart beat is about 65.  

I do still get Afib but not as bad as i did.   I am 47”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Taking 25 mg extended release daily around noon and also amlodopine besylate in AM. Assists in lowering blood pressure from around 140/80 to around 130/70. It does keep my heart rate down so when I do exercise I can actually go for longer because my inappropriate sinus tachycardia is minimized. 

I was originally prescribed this to assist in outbursts of physiologically induced sinus tachycardia of which I've not had since starting metoprolol.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,“I am a little tired and forgetful as well.  Those seem to be the most common side effects of metoprolol.  I also take flecainide and it has some of the same side effects as metoprolol so it's hard to tell which medication is causing this.  Sometimes a little hard to focus but together they seem to help with the Atrial fibrillation. ”,"

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have VSD, a bi-cuspid Aortic valve and Mirtal valve regurgitation. I am 37 years old and have been taking metoprolol for about 1 year as a result of some tachycardia/palpitations I experienced a while back.  I have had pre-hypertension (139/80) nearly all my life due to an enlarged heart caused by my hearts inefficiency from its defects.  Metoprolol seems to have controlled the arrhythmia's, although I will get one from time to time, but nothing of any duration. I have noticed a substantial decrease in energy levels, making it quite difficult to lose the extra 50lbs I am carrying around.  I work out regularly but I have not lost a single pound. It has not really impacted my blood pressure at all. I take 25mg twice daily.”","

Metoprolol,Toprol-XL (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I was put on 25mg once daily a little over a year ago and it seemed to work wonders for a good while. Due to some other issues though we increased my dose to 100mg a day and I am pretty much tired most of the day, but at least I can walk up stairs and not pass out or my heart doesn't feel like it will leap out of my chest... kind of the price to pay not to deal with the SVT. Hoping the tiredness wears off soon.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I took way too much nasal decongestant.... my blood pressure and heart rate was shooting through the roof and I could not sleep at all for 3days, so the doctor put me on 25mg once a day and wow! what a diff! like night and day, calm anxiety too, but I have trouble sleeping sometimes”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Dropped systolic a bit, and diastolic in a week or two. But by third week I was experiencing  consistent erectile dysfunction (ED).  The occasional runs, stuffy nose and aches and pains are ok to live with, but consistent ED is not, at least for me.  It just grows semi hard, half the size I really am, and takes 3-4 x longer.
Interesting that the factory doesn't list this effect.
I'm hoping doc switches me to  bysytolic, very few side effects, maybe have my life back”","

Metoprolol,Lopressor (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I recently began taking metoprolol about 2 months ago for an elevated resting heart rate (90-110 avg) and I’m VERY pleased & relieved with the results. Worked almost immediately with the lowest dose available. Now my resting hr is between 60-75. Now, my dr did have me try it singularly to treat my elevated hr & high bp, but it was ineffective on my bp. So, he put me on low dose of lisinopril as well and my bp went from 150-110 on avg, to 115/65 avg. I highly recommend Metoprolol for treatment of tachycardia (high heart rate).”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Prescribed 50mg day for post AFib/flutter ablation rate control while healing for a month or so.  I've taken the regular non ER version before for similar reasons after coming out of AFib/flutter but usually had to stop very soon due to dropping rate and BP below the low end of the normal ranges.  So far the ER tabs seem to be not as aggressive on that, but I'm not sure if I'll make the full recovery time with them.    I haven't had any of the ""loopiness"" or fog that I've had with the non ER version which were 25's cut in half 2x day.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“It brought the blood pressure into check, 120/75. The downside for me was ED. ONE pill of this and the party was over for a month or more. And cialis won't undo it either. This stuff has to wear off before the love life starts again. And when it does begin to work again, Spaghetti is better than you are for at least another 1-5 months. Stopped taking it and that's how long it took me to return to normal. I'm on Enalapril now. It works good too but the dang cough is driving me nuts. Looking for something else.”","

That's how sick I feel. 
I felt the same on losartan and doctor took me off that one. I don't know what to do next. Terrible drug for me. It's controlled my bp but the side effects are awful for me.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I recently switched from metaprolol, 1/2 of 25 mg/ day to brand name Toprol xl & have found the negative side effects- fatigue, too low blood pressure, dizziness, nausea- to be much less. I still feel a little of that about 12 hours after I take it- I figure that is a slight "" withdrawal"" effect, it lasts about 30-45 min. & I don't have it every day. When I took the generic ( manufacturer, PAR) I felt on a roller coaster, up & down all day. The time release delivery feels to be much smoother with the brand name, toprol- I recommend it. All in all, it works well, keeps my heart in sinus rhythm, but it's a tough drug to have to take.”","

Metoprolol,For Mitral Valve Prolapse:,"“I started taking 50mg of Toprol after being admitted to the hospital 6 days ago. I was told I had Mitral Valve Proplase and that I needed to take 50mg daily. It has helped in slowing my rapid heart beat down but the side effects have almost been unbearable. I have hardly slept, after taking the medicine I get short of breath and feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I take the medicine at bedtime. In the mornings when I wake for the first two to three hours I feel shaky, sweaty, nauseous, and extremely dizzy. My regular MD took me down to 25mg once daily and I still can't sleep and feel anxious. This is the first day taking 25mg so we'll see how I feel in the morning.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I have been taking Metoprolol for three years.  I had one episode two years ago, went to ER and it converted with an IV of something.  Was up to 170 when I got there.  I started taking 25 milligrams of Metoprolol twice a day and a lose dose aspirin once a day.  I had another episode last September.  They gave me Fleccinide (spelling?) and it reversed on its own.  The first time, I had very stressful day, drank huge amount of coffee, and didn't sleep well the night before.  The second time, I mowed both the front and back yard and did five minutes on stationary bike.  Other than that, the metoprolol has controlled it and I try to avoid stress, sleep well, and don't mow both yards at once.  The only side effect I have is fatigue.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“Metoprolol is an excellent beta blocker that fitted my condition.

They ran tests and I was fine, a while later I began waking up with a racing heart 140's. For a few days I believe it was just stress, but my doc changed my meds to Metoprolol. I've been on it for 10 years, at one point I lost 30lbs and it made my BP too low so I was taken off it for a year then got into a stressful situation and vitals back up so they put me back on. I never had any issues with this pill it keeps my BP normal and sometimes low and my heart rate is always low/normal. Somedays it gets too low in the low 60s and I'll get up and jump around lol I know that's not bad but for me I don't like it that low.

After three years I had a number of concerns and stopped taking this med- sexual desire increased as did erections, urine stream strong, fewer trips to the bathroom, and I care about the future again.

The only side effect that I've seen is that my voice gets hoarse very easily.

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I was put on metoprolol for SVT & IST after other medications made me worse, dropped my blood pressure too low etc. Although it never completely disappated the issues, I was going from everyday occurances to every 3-6months between each episode. No problems getting the heart rate up in exercise (still quite the opposite actually! I can reach 180bpm after 5mins) 
Unfortunately it didnt stop the progression to AF. After 6yrs of SVT & metoprolol I was further diagnosed with AF. Dosage was increased from 25mg to 50-75mg per day. Starting to work a little better now in preventing rapid AF however I still get slow AF. 
Dry mouth, cold extremities & occasional dizzy spells have been all too common however definitely a small price to pay.

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“I have POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)  and tried to switch from atenolol  to metoprolol 12.5 mg x 2 day. Zero effect so far. Raised diastolic BP and completely bedridden due to HR that seems getting higher by hour.”,"

Metoprolol,For Left Ventricular Dysfunction:,"“Only took METOPROLOL by Zydus (Indian manufacturer) for 4 days and was so nauseated all day.  I could barely eat, and started dry heaving . It was prescribed because I've been having shortness of breath and heart palpitations lately. Spent 2 days in a local hospital and tests determined I have a cardiac arrythmia issue in my left upper heart chamber. This med did absolutely nothing to curtail my symptoms, and the nausea all day had me miserable. I am stopping the med. I am also concerned about quality control of pharmaceuticals. Just not worth the risks and side effects.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“Metoprolol helped my blood pressure but it really spiked my Triglycerides.  I have been watching my cholesterol for a while now and everything was looking good.  I started on this med a few months ago and had another cholesterol test done.  Triglycerides went up to 238 from always being under 140.”,"

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I've been on Metoprolol for 6 weeks after an AF episode of 15 hrs 2 days after a total knee replacement. I was on opioids for pain and never developed constipation. Came off the opioids and find I have diarrhoea which seems to be the medication. I also developed vertigo 10 days ago. It's reduced in severity, but is still hanging around. Again seems likely to be the medication. Off all things meant to help me sleep, Metoprolol has made for some difficult sleepless nights, not something I've ever had before. At the same time it's controlling my heart rate and BP, and so far no more AF. My first week home from rehab I also suffered the anxious feeling, which was an unpleasant, crawly feeling in my chest. It seems to work though.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“I have taken Toprol XL for years for atrial fib and tachycardia. I get very anxious at times without this and my blood pressure and heart rate will race with the chance it could convert to AF. Lately however, my heart rate has fallen to low 40's taking only 10 mg and my doctor has taken me off it completely. I feel very shaky now. My hands visibly tremble and I notice I get more of an adrenaline rush when under pressure or fear. I need something to replace this because I don't want to experience AF again and I need something to calm me down. Any suggestions would be appreciated.”","

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I have been having daily migraines with aura for a couple of years, mostly likely triggered by too much stress at work and combination of long hours, lots of pressure and hostile environment. I was constantly under stress, with my body flooded with stress hormones, strong heart-beating etc. Metoprolol helped me a lot in reducing my stress level and adjusting to a more relaxed attitude at work. It calms you down by reducing your heart beat etc. From this perspective it was helpful for getting on a healthier path. It also helped reducing the migraines, even though they stayed. Over the longer run, you need to take higher dosage to achieve a similar effect. at some stage I had the impression the drug didn't help much any longer, so stopped.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed this medicine just before my triple by-pass heart surgery in April 2014 and it has worked fairly good for my high blood pressure and has worked wonders for my  aura type migraine problem. I was having up to 5 migraine spells per week before my surgery to none since my surgery when I started taking Metoprolol. I am very grateful the migraine problem has been reduced to almost none. I do have a few side-effects from this drug, but I can tolerate them ok. Nothing could be as bad as those migraines I had, so the side-effects don't bother me.”",1
Metoprolol,For Premature Ventricular Depolarizations:,"“Was given metoprolol to use prn for premature atrial contraction (PAC) and developed bloating, indigestion and intermittent constipation. Only used it at night small dose 12.5 mg. After a few weeks woke up at 2 am with severe LLQ pain and 101 fever. Was dx with diverticulitis. Very painful and heavy duty antibiotics. Not sure if this happened because of metoprolol but will never take it again. 
Stopped the metoprolol it never stopped the PAC’s anyway. and started on Inderal.”","

Metoprolol,,"“Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg has been a Godsend to me. After years of having palpitations and being told my tests (ekgs, stress, halter monitor) were normal,  that it was just anxiety.  Sometimes I was having several a minute to only a few times a day.  They scared me which just increased my anxiety. Finally my dr said I had slight tachycardia, my resting heart rate was usually around 100bpm and prescribed me metoprolol 50mg twice a day.  The first week i hated this medicine.  Swore it made me feel 'just not right'. I believe it was from reading negative reviews. After a couple weeks, palps gone,  rating heart rate a around 60bpm. A year later I can say palps are rare.  This medicine worked wonderful for me.”","

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I am very excited that metoprolol has helped me so much with migraines and headaches. I started taking it for SVT,  which it also helps tremendously.

Metoprolol,For Heart Attack:,"“I previously posted over a year ago on this subject. After nine months of taking 50mg/day, my cardiologist dropped me down to 25mg, once per day of Metoprolol Succinate. I'd like to be med-free, but I don't know if it is possible at this point. I'm walking/jogging 15-18 miles per week, and in better shape now than I've ever been. I feel great most of the time, but still get extremely tired. I don't know if that's the drug, or just natural aging. :)”",1
Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Works well with rapid heart beat caused by ""Dumping Syndrome"" which began
after having very major surgery on my Stomach and Duodenam.
The name of the surgery was Pyloroplasty, Vagotomy (severing the vagus nerve) and Hiatel
Hernia repair back in 1985, followed by removal of my Gallbladder and appendix two
years later which exacerbated the effects of rapid heart beat. Metoprolol along with Ativan
sublingual, keeps the ""Dumping Syndrome"" in check most of the time, until I eat something
that doesn't agree with my anatomy, (Creamy sauces, alchohol, milk, etc.)”",1
Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I was put on this medication for trigiminis & couplets that were picked up after a 24 hr holter monitor.

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed Lopressor after suffering a hypertensive encephalopathy in Juy 2008.

Metoprolol,For Mitral Valve Prolapse:,"“I was prescribed metoprolol for my MVP. I have been on it for about 2 years and It's really helped with the palpitations. I was on 25mg and was perfect for me.  I recently developed high blood pressure and my cardiologist took me off of the metoprolol, and we tried various BP medications, I had side effects (double vision, bloating, diarrhea, headaches, you name it.  She wants me on a beta blocker and beta blockers causes all kinds of side effects. She put me back on metoprolol but now I am on 50mg a day,  Since I have been on the higher dosage, I've gained weight and can't lose it, Again another side effect of this drug.   My wrists and face are swollen. I go again to see her in July and I am almost certain she will up the dosage because the blood pressure is not what it should be .  I am going to suggest that she put me back on my 25 mg and use something else that will work with the metoprolol to help lower my blood pressure.  This is the only drug that can work for my MVP, but at a lower dosage.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,“I had two stents put in after heart attack. About three months later I started getting dizzy and at times would go down to my knee. I was on 5 mg metoprolol. Then I was put on 25 mg metoprolol and had the same thing going on. So I was put on 50 mg and had one time heavy breathing but that was all went away after 20 minutes. Have been on 50 for 3 weeks nothing else. Time will tell. I noticed no triggers outside of caffeine.”,"

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for High Blood Pressure:,"“It got my blood pressure under control with 25mg metoprolol , I take it with 40mg propranolol divided 2 times a day. Must say it helped allot. 
Had social anxiety which has been almost gone away. 

Sure it takes a few weeks/months to get into it, at the beginning I felt depressed, tired, erectile dysfunction (which is easily treatable with citrulline/Arginine or viagra) and got low blood sugar. Now after almost a year I have mild side effects but are treatable (tiredness) 

Have tried before: diuretics, ace inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and ARBs and for me beta blockers are the best since the other medications had far worse side effects.

Something I have to add is I might have POTS (self diagnosed) and maybe it’s why it works so well for me. My pulse gets from 60 to under 100 bpm without these.”","

Metoprolol,For Premature Ventricular Depolarizations:,"“I’ve been on Propafanone for about 5 years after went into Afib and haven’t had any other attacks since. All of a sudden Propafanone started giving me dizziness, got PVCs for hours on end, like felt them every other beat. Cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol 25 mg. Took it and it ruined me, BP dropped, heart rate dropped was in the ER with Hb of around 45-50 bpressure 80/40. Not good. Finally discontinued Propafanone and obviously Metoprolol.

2 "
Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“metoprolol worked well for me I guess my problem was adrenaline causing my SVT it would happen when I was sleep deprived and having a panic attacks usually verapamil didn’t help as much but I think this drug cured the issue for me only side effects I have noticed is feeling more lazy but you can live with it. For reference I have had 4 bad SVT attacks and I get panic attacks almost everyday but been taking it for a few weeks and if it was gonna happen there is a few times it would have happened before. I recommend this treatment also other negatives says your not supposed to take Benadryl while on this medicine cause it may lower your blood pressure and I rely on that to sleep but every solution breeds a new problem”,"

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I only took this for 3 days.  My blood pressure had started to drop, but I woke up the morning after taking the 3rd dose with red spots on my arms that looked like the beginning of a bruise.  My arms felt tired all day.  I held a big bag of apples in each hand at the orchard for about 10 minutes and on the way home noticed more ""bruises"" appearing on both arms.  The same thing happened that evening while shopping - I was holding a stack of clothes over my arm and red spots and streaks started appearing on the arm I was holding the clothes over.

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“My husband has congestive heart failure.
Was admitted to hospital with fluid on hear & lungs 2 weeks ago.  He had never experienced AFIB before.  He has been on Atenolol for 13 years with b/p controlled.  While in hospital his monitor started showing AFIB so they stopped atenolol and started Metoprelol.  He has been weak for several years due to CHF.  Now his is combative, not sleeping, talking in his sleep.  But he remembers none of it.  Is this part of the drug side affect?  Or due to the fact the CHF is much worse and he is facing hard reality?  Any suggestions or ideas will be helpful.  Calling cardiologist tomorrow”",1
Metoprolol,For Mitral Valve Prolapse:,“20 years of misery and then I come across this gift from God! Give it a shot! FYI- some generics are WAY better than others so if one doesn't work don't give up hope. Plus you can have it prescribed three months at a time to save on costs! Good Luck! Keep that heart rate down! ;)”,"

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):,"“Used it in connection with Marfans Syndrome. My dose was 50mg. My heart rate lowered as intended, and it did help with some anxiety symptoms, which was a nice bonus. However I became tired all the time, I lost interest in my studies, and it also caused slurred speech.
After 2 weeks of usage, the 50mg dose was not working as effectively in terms of keeping my heart rate down. I did not see any reason to keep going, as raising the dose to 100mg would have probably destroyed my life. My doctor agreed that the side effects would cause long term damage, and I'm being put on a different beta blocker now.
The medicine is cheap, and the benefits it had in the beginning was really nice, so I wish that my body didn't react so negatively to metoprolol.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I started having PSVT when I was 23, now 42. I was also on verapamil, propranolol and atenolol at the same time. I felt like the walking dead from time I got up till I went to bed. So had RF ablation done. Was fine for several years, no medicines, no problems. Then PSVT was back full force was put on digoxin that was increased several times due to lack of control. Had stress test done and after just over 1 minute was stopped by Doctor put in hospital taken off digoxin and started on 50 mg of metoprolol. I now have fair control of PSVT with just minor problems that I can control maybe once a month unless stressed and PSVT can be trouble couple times a day. Main side effect is energy level REAL low.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I was prescribed Metoprolol for tachycardia because my regular beta blocker was unavailable.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I have SVT and high blood pressure. After 10 years the dr. switched me to Metoprolol from Atenolol. The medication works great with one caveat - you MUST check which brand you're getting.  The dr. changed my dosage, which resulted in different dosage pills. Suddenly my blood pressure jumped and my heart was beating erratically, chest pains (which I've never had), and I was constantly worn out. I checked the brands of the former medications and the new and found they were different. I switched back to the old meds at the new dosage for a couple of days and within 1 day my blood pressure dropped 20 points and I felt back to normal. Now the pharmacy special orders the Mylan brand, as the Aurobindo doesn't work at all.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“Metoprolol has been a life saver for me.  Since they stopped making Timolol in pill form, and trying three other beta blockers, this one is the best.  I was beginning to doubt anything would completely control my tachycardia and high blood pressure but this does both.  No real side effects after the first month or so, which was lethargy, but that was worth it for the long term good Metoprolol has done for me.”","

Metoprolol,,"“This is by far the worst medication I’ve ever been on and I was only on it for a week and then tapered off. Extreme dizziness, and felt like complete rubbish during that week so decided to get off it. Went to the doctor one day and said my heart was pounding but it was only at 86 and put me on Metoprolol (12.5 mg twice a day). After a week of poisoning myself I decided to get off it. The anxiety and always waking up in a panic attack was crazy. The withdrawals are ugly also though but I’d rather tough it out then go back on this stuff. I don’t feel like myself at all anymore but I’m hoping it subsides as I was only on a small dose for a short period of time. Everyone should be careful with this poison.”","

Metoprolol,For Benign Essential Tremor:,"“I use this both for high blood pressure and for tremors caused by my mood stabilizers. If I miss my dose by even a few hours I notice the tremors become quite quickly worse than while on metoprolol. Works well, but not perfectly. Definitely would be completely miserable and quite debilitated without it.”","

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Migraines and thunderclaps for last 3 weeks, everyday except one and raging from mildly annoying to viscous thunder claps. Pain relief has had minimal effect, I haven't been to work and most days too tired to function.
Dr gave metoprolol, been on it 2 days, I am still getting migraines and also a new side effect. I feel like I'm on a merry go round when I sit up or stand. My balance is so off I wanna stop the drug. Is it too early to tell if its working?”","

8 "
Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm giving this med a 7 so far just because I haven't had any real side effects with it, like I did with another bp med (can't remember the name). However, @ 25mg I still have bouts of high readings, so when I see my PCP this week, she might raise it to 50mg. I will say that I prefer to see a Cardiologist for this because I am terrified of exercising. Yes, I know exercise and weight loss can lower my bp to healthy levels, but I can't understand I can exert myself while having high bp. Shouldn't it first be controlled with meds first before exercising?”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“This is a miracle drug.  I take 1/2 of a 25mg pill in evening.  Gone are the constant heart pounding when I sit and lie down.  I suffered from it for 2 years.  A whole pill made my blood pressure too low, but half is perfect.”","

Metoprolol,For Mitral Valve Prolapse:,"“I had terrible symptoms of MVP that landed me in the hospital for 5 days. I started taking this medicine 25 mg a day and my symptoms are so much better.

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I was put on 50 mg 3 X a day for rapid, arrhythmic heartbeat and high blood pressure, in November last year.  At first, it made me very sleepy and dizzy, but I have gotten over that. It lowered my heart rate into the low 60's and 50's, occasionally upper 40's. Halving the dose has not changed this; I am hoping to be off it, or at least on an even lower dose, after my next cardiology appointment in June.  I think it is making me forgetful. That has definitely been a problem since taking it, although I was a bit of an absent-minded professor before. It may also have helped lower my blood pressure, although I have made some diet and lifestyle changes that would affect that, also.”","

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,“I am taking Metoprolol 50mg 3 times per day since the beginning of January and my heart rate is still very high137 bpm on average for a seventy one year old male previously active and in good health.  When I climb stairs I am short of breath feel weaker than normal. Previous taking Digoxin 62.5mg x3/day. This controlled/capped my HR at 115bpm without side effects. So my HR has increased by comparison since starting Metoprolol. I would welcome all your comment.”,"

Metoprolol,For Atrial Fibrillation:,"“Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day did nothing for my AFib, however when my cardiologist put me on Metoprolol succinate ER 25 mg once a day it straightened my AFib up because it's an extended release pill that slowly releases the medicine throughout the day and night. Before I took it I had to have ablation done which worked for 5 years then it came back stronger until the extended release version of Metoprolol was given to me. I no longer see my cardiologist every 3 months but every 6 months.My cardiologist and I are both happy with Metoprolol succinate ER 25 mg for me. It works well.”","

Metoprolol,For Heart Attack:,"“I take metoprolol tartrate not metoprolol with hydrochlorthiazide, however I have noticed a marked frequency of urination and polyuria after starting this medication.  My doctor suspected a urinary tract infection (although I am not experiencing dysuria, fever, chills or having any other typical UTI symptoms).  Urinalysis was negative, prostate exam was negative, cystoscopy was negative.

The medicine is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but having to urinate every two hours around the clock is certainly interfering with my sleep.  I did find a reference on Drugs.com that said increased urination was a rarely encountered side effect of this drug, but my doctors insist it doesn't have that side effect and I have spent a fortune ruling out other conditions.”","

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol) for Heart Attack:,"“I was started on Metoprolol Tartrate for Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia and Long QT syndrome. At first I was on 25 once a day. That did nothing. Increased to 25mg twice a day. Still did nothing. Was increased to 100MG twice a day and it brought my heart rate down but not a lot and was still having a lot of symptoms. My usual resting without the medication is 130bpm and when I exercise it gets as high as 220 bpm. I get palpitations, SOB, fainting and etc. My most recent cardiac monitoring indicated needing to increase my dose so I was increased to 150 MG twice a day. My resting rate is on average 86 bpm now and they don't want to increase the metoprolol anymore so they're adding Ivabradine to the metoprolol. Its a good med and it has lowered my heart rate and lowered symptoms just not enough for me to be comfortable.”","

Within 4 hours of first minimum dosage tablet, heart rate was below 40bpm, blood pressure was 80/40.  Barely conscious.  Extremely fatigue the next day.  Took 1/2 of minimum dose tablet and same response within 4 hours.  Third day took a tiny piece, maybe 1/10th of a pill and same results.  Stress echocardiogram revealed healthy heart, no blockages and normal ejection fraction.

Emergency room doctor and cardiologist said to keep taking it and increase dose.  No way in he'll!  Zero out of ten for me.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Oh my side effects were terrible. Racing heart, sick feeling, anxiety, depression, tingling hands and feet.

Metoprolol,Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol) for Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“I’ve been on beta blockers before and this one really took me for a ride. Was fine and slowed down a 5 day episode of palpitations but after day 3 I had intense body aches and head aches the craziest brain fog I just did not feel like myself told the dr and they said take half (of a 25 mg) and ended up blacking out 3 hours later please beware because I really felt like I was going crazy and one day off I already feel better”,"

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My first day on Metroprolol I was experiencing hallucinations; I'd taken it on an empty stomach and since taking it with food I haven't had any repeats.  I saw a green fairy for a brief second. I also saw a cartoon character on the wall, bright and colorful, a little  guy with a  scythe cutting at the base of a  large tree. My doctor asked me if I wanted to switch, I said no, I take it with food now. I get extremely tired on it. When I take my doctor visits I feel slow, calm but just tired and slow.  I've had a bit of a cough on it to say I think yes it does affect the lungs. I live with anxiety and  it calms down on this, I sleep a lot and I have some very wild dreams on it. The one about being abducted was very interesting. Is it making me depressed or is it just relaxing to a point that I am able to cry properly, I don't know.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,“I was put on metoprolol 50mg after my heart started to race every time I would move or do anything. The 50mg helped some but didn't keep it all the way down so then they tried me on 100mg which did the trick while I was moving but then when I wasn't it was dropping between 30-40beats so then they tried just 25mg 4 times a day and I was still having problems. It made me tired. I don't know if part of the problem is the doctors I have been seeing don't know what exactly is wrong with my heart and why it does this. Just yesterday I went to the ER after being in the hospital for a week and the doctor gave me propranolol 10mg 3 times a day which is helping. ”,"

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I had an ablation that put an end to my AFIB and flutter, but left me with periodic SVT.  Started taking 25mg metoprolol twice daily, but no relief from muscle fatigue and shortness of breath.  I've just started on 50mg 2X, which I'm apprehensive about because the drug does tend to cause sleepiness and lethargy in some people. Interestingly, Valsalva maneuvers have little effect on my SVT.  When I had atrial flutter, carotid message stopped it straightaway.  The only thing that seems to help with SVT is splashing cold water on my face or doing yoga breathing (inhale, hold, and slowly exhale while counting to 10).  Sometimes I have to repeat that until I'm literally blue in the face.  To quote the Terminator, ""I'll be back.""”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started on metoprolol 2 months ago at 25 mg, twice a day (plus hydrochorothiazide at 25 mg that I have been taking for 3 months). This is to treat a high systolic pressure that was originally at 145 though my diastolic was at 75. Metoprolol had no effect for 3 weeks until my systolic dropped to 127 from about 137. At the end of that 3 weeks I increased metoprolol to 75 mg/day and by the end of the 6th week my systolic had climed to 134. So I am not sure what effect it is having, except that I experience symptoms of a dry mouth which is unpleasant.”","

Metoprolol,For Heart Failure:,"“I was diagnosed with heart failure and was prescribed metoprolol more than 16 years ago! I also was briefly on Coreg (carvedilol), a more effective heart medication, in my opinion, but I couldn't take the side effects, including the racing heart and the nervousness.  Let's face it, most medications cause side effects, some more serious than others, because of this asked my cardiologist to allow me to take all of my heart meds at night, which made a huge difference in my being anxious, dizzy, and lightheaded during day.”",1
Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Pff, don't even know where to start. I took 50 mg of Metoprolol I'm addition to my 25 mg of Losartan back in February. I'm taking Losartan since 2013, never had any problem. After I start Metoprolol, 2 month later I've noted that my pulse is going down occasionally. Didn't give me much to think up until July when I start to nearly lose my conscience. 3 weeks of nightmare, my blood pressure was very low but my pulse was 50. Once I've been taking by the ambulance. At some point my doctor told me to stop taking it ,which I did. And my pulse is back to normal now.I  have panic attacks instead. 3 weeks now without Metoprolol and I'm getting worse. I did check everything I could've possibly check, everything looks normal. One thing I know, Metoprolol ruined my last few months. I'm even scared to take my regular medication since.

Adalat isn't enough for my pain. Now, I feel OK, acceptable side effects from both of the products. I still don't know whether I should try PREDUCTAL Sustained Release Tablets 35 mg instead of Metoprolol Sustained Release Tablets 50 mg.

Cardiologist ended up prescribing this (25 mg once a day) with Paradaxa. 
The meto has kept my blood pressure down and AFib episodes are relatively rare now and only short lasting. So, no complaints so far. Feel much better than I did, although I get tired in late afternoon. But, this might be due to always having trouble sleeping.”","

Metoprolol,For Left Ventricular Dysfunction:,“After a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the drug has relaxed my heart muscle allowing it to pump blood better and also eliminated or lowered the extra heart beats that I experienced.

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“I had taken Metoprolol for months and noticed it wasn’t doing as good a job at blood pressure control as Bystolic and then as I increased the dosage to compensate the side effects started. The anxiety was unreal! I had been treated for afib and soon after Cryoblation the afib was back. I really think after reading these reviews that the Metoprolol is to blame. I have been off of it now 2 days and am back on Bystolic and still have some anxiety and palpitations but they seem to be slowly subsiding. Don’t use this blood pressure medication if want to keep your sanity. I also want to note that I had extreme trouble sleeping while on Metoprolol. I’m never trying any other beta blocker but Bystolic.”,"

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,“I started on metoprolol 25mg twice per day about 3 years ago for high BP and chest pain. In the past month I have started getting PVC and chest pain along with very low blood pressure averaging around 95/65 and when I lay down it goes even lower I stay so sleepy and can feel the flutters. It's very scary. My cardio Dr is doing a bunch of test on me but I wish he would figure this out quickly it's causing me severe anxiety. I'm so worried that now I have diminished cardiac output. It's got me afraid to go to sleep. I was wondering is there a better med other than metoprolol for PVC that won't drop my bp so low? I clearly don't need my bp going any lower.”,"

One Sunday afternoon, they were especially bad and I didn't understand what they were. When I saw that my blood pressure was unusually high as well (probably from the anxiety I felt) I went to the ER. There they did all the appropriate tests and the ongoing PVCs showed clearly on the ekg.  They told me what they were and that they were very likely benign and to follow up with my doctor. He put me on the metoprolol before bed and I've been free of PVCs since. My BP which had been pretty much normal is now slightly below normal. Otherwise, I've not had any noticeable side effects. It's also very cheap and covered under my Medicare part D drug plan.”","

Metoprolol,For Supraventricular Tachycardia:,"“I am a 22 y/o woman who was diagnosed with SVT after having frequent, long and intense episodes of a resting heart rate at 170. This medicine cured me of the high heart rate but I became very depressed and got anxiety out of nowhere. I felt numb and dead inside honestly. I was taking 25mg twice daily of the extended release kind. I am 6’0 145lbs. My doctor is letting me try getting off the medicine. So far I have felt like a new person and finally feel happy and not as out of it and mentally absent.  I took 1/2 the pill instead for each dose and then switched to 1/2 at bedtime. Soon I will try not taking it at all. So far so good. This medicine made me almost suicidal and extremely uncomfortable in my own mind, body, and life. I hope things will go continue to go well being off the medicine. If not I will not let myself take the original 25mg/twice daily dose because that made me feel like a depressed psychotic zombie.”","

The brain fog is HORRIBLE, I can’t think straight, and thankfully I work from home or I’d be screwed. I can’t process things, it feels like my brain is just gone. But hey, at least my heart rate is down? This also gives me terrible dizziness about an hour after taking it, I feel like I’m spinning and losing balance. I had a very weird episode of palpitations last night as well, like rolling electric shocks in my chest.

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was put on Metoprolol Succinate ER 50mg for high blood pressure (150/80) when COVID started almost 2 years ago.  When I began having shortness of breathe and chest pains I was too afraid to go to the doctor so I persevered, not knowing the cause.  I lost 20 pounds but I kept feeling worse and worse, barely able to function and extremely depressed.  One day I started checking my blood pressure later in the day instead of in the morning and was shocked to see it was dropping to 90/50 and pulse 50 which is when I was having episodes like I was going to pass out.  Finally, after seeing my doctor I've gradually cut down to a quarter pill (12.5mg) which I'm also afraid to completely stop even though my bp is very low to normal all of the time.  I'm sure this pill helps people and wouldn't want to interfere with anyones meds but getting off of this is brutal. I have anxiety already and each time I cut back it's really bad and headaches for weeks.”","

Metoprolol,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on Metropolol for about two years now.This drug is giving me awful side effects and I am only on 25mg a day. The two worse side effects for me is tiredness and bile puke up at night. I had forgotten to take this med a few times and I knew it because the night puke ups was better. I cut my dosage in half and told my doctor that I have night time puke ups. He put me back on the full 25mg dosage. When I told him I was having difficulty taking this med, the Dr. told me to take it anyway. He can say that, it’s not him having the puke ups at night. I went down to a half dose again. I can’t stand getting dizzy at times, the tiredness, heartburn. I am sensitive to meds I know but I can’t imagine taking a higher dose of this medication. I would like to get off it all together. I even tried taking Metropolol in the morning hoping that the side effects would wear off ,but it didn’t matter when I took it. It did lower my blood pressure a little, so that is why I am still on a half dose”","

I developed palpitations a couple years ago, heart monitor showed SVTs and PACs.  Because the palpitations continued Dr. upped the dosage to 50 mg per day which did wonders, no more palpitations.  Then back in Sept. 2021 I took Sudafed for sinus congestion that wouldn't clear up.  That started a cascade of events with palpitations happening every 10-15 minutes all day long.  Super scary!  Doctor increased the dose to 100 mg daily which knocked down the palpitations to 1-2 per day some days and none on other days.  This drug has been great for me. No side effects other than a slower HR as seen on the EKG.  Still waiting on results from the latest cardiac wearable monitor from when the palpitations were virtually non-stop.”","

Metoprolol,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Prescribed this medication originally for migraines. I take 200mg of Metoprolol. I suffered debilitating migraines since I was 15 years old, originally the med worked but has side effects. It helped with my anxiety disorder as well. I started getting Botox for migraines & no longer needed it. I tried quitting cold turkey, 6 months ago (my dr said it was okay), & it was awful. My blood pressure skyrocketed. I have never had heart or blood pressure problems in the past. I’m trying to figure out how to slowly come off this medication now because my migraines are now controlled with the Botox shots 3-4X a year. If you are suffering horrible migraines more than 5-6+X a month, I would recommend this medication. Keep in mind though that if you stop taking it, your migraines will likely return, so I was happy to have relief from debilitating migraines, but years later, I’m trying to come off it and it isn’t easy. Epipens don’t work on this med, can’t get allergy shots.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was on amlodipine for 3 months after discovering I had high blood pressure
 Before that I was on lisinopil. Both medications was as terrible. From vision changes, hearing a heartbeat sound in my ear. Rapid heart rate, feeling tired. Both meds lowered my blood pressure but it was ruining my life. So I bought a treadmill for about 300 bucks and walked f1 mile a day and lost 20 pounds, take 400mg of magnesium citrate a day. Eat fruits and vegetables and cut down on fatty and unhealthy foods. I weaned off the BP meds myself over a month's time and I no longer take them.. Exercising losing weight and changing your diet will does the trick.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“61-year old male here. After years of marginally high BP (~130/90), my BP started to climb. My GP started me on diuretics, which made me feel like I was chewing  cotton balls. He switched to Lisinopril. That gave me dizzy spells, often lasting several minutes and striking out of nowhere. I shifted to Losartan, first at 50mg then 100mg. That was a disaster- brain fog, slower reaction time, anger and irritability, inability to concentrate. Now I'm on amlodipine, 10 mg once per day, and am experiencing listlessness, depression, more brain fog, and somnolence. My BP is lower when I'm on these meds. I understand that medical practices get better government ratings and better reimbursements when they keep their patients within certain guidelines, including controlling BP. I feel that there is little concern for the big picture of mental health and well-being. I'm of a mind that I'd rather let my BP issues take me out early rather than eking out a few more months or years feeling like rubbish”","

Stopped it and next two days still very high anxiety, breathless and chest tightness. Really wanted this to work and bring down blood pressure and I’m happy to ride out side effects but this drug is scary, thought I’d have to go to A&E but rode it out. Day 3 now since I took the tablets and all improved but now bad stomach pains, diarrhea and back pains. Think it’s all the end of this drug coming out of system .

After one and a half years, the CONSTANT dizziness was crushing me, I couldn't concentrate, do anything physical, walk far, ride my bike, my work was suffering and I was beginning to feel depressed and hopeless. My doctor finally (why so long?) took me off the amlodipine, and within 48 hours my dizziness had gone, but also I realized that serious back pain that had been torture for over a year faded away. Over the time I took this medicine, my gripes included painful urination, serious muscular pain in my leg and in my back. The worst thing was that my doctor was leaning more and more towards psycho somatic causes and trying to convince me I was provoking the symptoms due to depression. He wanted to put me medication for this. It DISGUSTS me that he didn't listen to me, that he didn't take me seriously, that he didn't take the amlodipine side effects into consideration until I argued with him for nearly an hour about it.”","

Constant leg cramps, heavy legs, migraines, elevated liver enzymes (fatty liver disease) and worst of all a dull isolated personality like I wasn’t myself anymore. I felt like I didn’t have any ambition or desire for anything. Not myself anymore. I kept telling my doctor something was wrong until I forgot to take my medicine my mind felt better but was beating out of my chest from not taking it I can hear and feel it pound so hard.

My skin was tightly stretched & shiny & became bright red with blotches & swelling spreading from both feet, ankles, extending up to calves. I rang Pharmacist who advised I should contact GP. Two phone calls later my GP advised I should stop taking the tablets & an appointment was given for a review. The huge swelling & severe inflammation has subsided but not completely gone. I’ve read that it will take 11.5 days for the drug to be eliminated from my system so hoping I will be back to feeling more normal without these horrid side effects.

As I kept taking this side affects worsened. I’m constantly fatigue, sleepy, jittery, easily tired and at night my arms feel like they are asleep and have to move them around. Recently my heart is constantly racing that almost called for emergency help. I had to control myself with deep breaths to calm down. I’m checking my pressure 3 times a day because my heart is racing out of control and afraid that I’m having a heart attack.  I’m getting off this meds. And I’m not waiting for the doctor to tell me to do so. This is not for everyone . If I would have known how serious the effects are would have not accepted.

I also had insomnia even though i was exhausted! I stopped taking it today but I’m still feeling the chest pains and palpitations, although they aren’t as intense.

I was so scared also had back pain in my kidney area,  and super thirsty ! I drink a lot of water and fluids anyway but I was really worried when I felt as if I just couldn’t drink enough water over the night.

Each doctor I’ve seen and spoken with has said Amlodipine wouldn’t cause any of this. I don't think they know, my only reason for starting this medication was high blood pressure. Pray for me, I need a doctor who will listen.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was on amlodipine for 3 months after discovering I had high blood pressure
 Before that I was on lisinopil. Both medications was as terrible. From vision changes, hearing a heartbeat sound in my ear. Rapid heart rate, feeling tired. Both meds lowered my blood pressure but it was ruining my life. So I bought a treadmill for about 300 bucks and walked f1 mile a day and lost 20 pounds, take 400mg of magnesium citrate a day. Eat fruits and vegetables and cut down on fatty and unhealthy foods. I weaned off the BP meds myself over a month's time and I no longer take them.. Exercising losing weight and changing your diet will does the trick.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“61-year old male here. After years of marginally high BP (~130/90), my BP started to climb. My GP started me on diuretics, which made me feel like I was chewing  cotton balls. He switched to Lisinopril. That gave me dizzy spells, often lasting several minutes and striking out of nowhere. I shifted to Losartan, first at 50mg then 100mg. That was a disaster- brain fog, slower reaction time, anger and irritability, inability to concentrate. Now I'm on amlodipine, 10 mg once per day, and am experiencing listlessness, depression, more brain fog, and somnolence. My BP is lower when I'm on these meds. I understand that medical practices get better government ratings and better reimbursements when they keep their patients within certain guidelines, including controlling BP. I feel that there is little concern for the big picture of mental health and well-being. I'm of a mind that I'd rather let my BP issues take me out early rather than eking out a few more months or years feeling like rubbish”","

Day 1 severe dizziness headache and very bad chest pain and a wired feeling. Day 2 anxiety through the roof, could not think straight, dizzy, breathless. And blood pressure going up not down. Stopped it and next two days still very high anxiety, breathless and chest tightness. Really wanted this to work and bring down blood pressure and I’m happy to ride out side effects but this drug is scary, thought I’d have to go to A&E but rode it out. Day 3 now since I took the tablets and all improved but now bad stomach pains, diarrhea and back pains. Think it’s all the end of this drug coming out of system . First time I’ve taken blood pressure med and really scared me. Disappointed. I stopped it myself as the doctor would probably say try longer, nope! Maybe more exercise.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“From day one I experienced light headedness and once fainted. After one and a half years, the CONSTANT dizziness was crushing me, I couldn't concentrate, do anything physical, walk far, ride my bike, my work was suffering and I was beginning to feel depressed and hopeless. My doctor finally (why so long?) took me off the amlodipine, and within 48 hours my dizziness had gone, but also I realized that serious back pain that had been torture for over a year faded away. Over the time I took this medicine, my gripes included painful urination, serious muscular pain in my leg and in my back. The worst thing was that my doctor was leaning more and more towards psycho somatic causes and trying to convince me I was provoking the symptoms due to depression. He wanted to put me medication for this. It DISGUSTS me that he didn't listen to me, that he didn't take me seriously, that he didn't take the amlodipine side effects into consideration until I argued with him for nearly an hour about it.”","

Constant leg cramps, heavy legs, migraines, elevated liver enzymes (fatty liver disease) and worst of all a dull isolated personality like I wasn’t myself anymore. I felt like I didn’t have any ambition or desire for anything. Not myself anymore. I kept telling my doctor something was wrong until I forgot to take my medicine my mind felt better but was beating out of my chest from not taking it I can hear and feel it pound so hard.

Most of my BP readings is 145/85; I told my primary physician that my now ankles  swell; a chronic headache  after I take it; and earache.  I went to ENT and took a battery of tests which ENT then referred me for a brain scan.  I am debating on that referral.  I stopped taking amlodipine on 9/6 and went to my rheumatologist on 9/11; without taking bp my reading was 143/84  I have come to the conclusion, I want something other than amlodipine.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Female Age 77. I started on Amlodipine 5mg 6 weeks ago. My BP when checked by GP had improved so I was delighted. 4 weeks on the side effects increased with tinnitus (ringing ears), intense stomach cramps & the trots (especially during night), tiredness, dizzy spells, weight gain & fluid retention in legs & feet. My skin was tightly stretched & shiny & became bright red with blotches & swelling spreading from both feet, ankles, extending up to calves. I rang Pharmacist who advised I should contact GP. Two phone calls later my GP advised I should stop taking the tablets & an appointment was given for a review. The huge swelling & severe inflammation has subsided but not completely gone. I’ve read that it will take 11.5 days for the drug to be eliminated from my system so hoping I will be back to feeling more normal without these horrid side effects.

As I kept taking this side affects worsened. I’m constantly fatigue, sleepy, jittery, easily tired and at night my arms feel like they are asleep and have to move them around. Recently my heart is constantly racing that almost called for emergency help. I had to control myself with deep breaths to calm down. I’m checking my pressure 3 times a day because my heart is racing out of control and afraid that I’m having a heart attack.  I’m getting off this meds. And I’m not waiting for the doctor to tell me to do so. This is not for everyone . If I would have known how serious the effects are would have not accepted. The effects that are labeled sound very routine like most drugs do. This drug needs to be more informative and descriptive of how serious the effects are. We’re taking this drug blinding and thinking that the effects are minor. It should be banned!”","

Day 3 chest pain and heart palpitations, extreme dry mouth, Flushing (feeling warm like a fever was coming), fatigue, muscle aches, stomach pain/bloating/gas, yeast discharge, and this weird stinging sensation in my thigh like I was being stung by a bee over and over again. I also had insomnia even though i was exhausted! I stopped taking it today but I’m still feeling the chest pains and palpitations, although they aren’t as intense.

I stopped taking it and slept the night sitting up. I felt depressed and anxiety irritable no energy. I almost died on lisinopril having to rush to hospital with terrible swollen tongue even uvula. They gave me every shot they had which I thought I might die from. Adrenaline shot is the worst. After a few months on norvasc at night laying down each night it got harder to breathe especially through my nose. This is my second day off and I bought 4 natural remedies and I finally feel like myself. I had no desire to do anything. I think these medicines are like poison.

I was so scared also had back pain in my kidney area,  and super thirsty ! I drink a lot of water and fluids anyway but I was really worried when I felt as if I just couldn’t drink enough water over the night. I was  waking up every hour with not only the already anxious panic of insomnia and fear I would not ever get more than an hour of sleep at a time again but the feeling of needing water because of dry mouth and thirst really scared me.

I was also tired the first couple of days and my legs felt heavy on my daily 2-mile walk -- that also resolved by the second week. It's working for me though my goal is to lose enough weight and exercise enough to eventually get off it. I'm a 62-year old female.”","

It helps decrease my usual 170/104 to approx 150/70 but only for a few hours. I am fatigued, headaches and super cold feet and hands constantly. I also have muscle cramps. I feel as if I had a heart attack a few days ago but my doctor says its gastritis. The side effects are worse than hypertension itself! Maybe I need a new medicine and/or a new physician.

I've been taking this garbage for 35 years and have had a multiple of effects from it not realizing this whole time it was this prescription causing it.  I've seen so many doctors about my side effects. They all knew I was taking Norvasc, but not one ever mentioned that it could be a side effect of this drug.  I've had peripheral neuropathy (feels like someone has poured hot lava down my thighs and is dripping to my feet).  I've had tinnitus, itchy rashes breaking out on my body, headaches galore, and at 62 years old, I now have TMJ. Yes, I'm blaming my TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction) on this drug.  It has caused my leg muscles to tighten up and I imagine it's doing the same thing to my jaw.  It did control my blood pressure well, but I'd rather not take any meds if this is how I have to live the rest of my life.  I took myself off of 2 years ago, but could not get through the withdrawals.  It caused my heart to feel like it was beating out of my chest and non stop migraines.”",1

I also experience Nausea with this medicine and a loss of Appetite, which, in part, is good as I'm overweight. However I could do without the Nausea.

Loss of energy and movement, I can't do what I used to do. Not even walk up or down a small hill. Palpitations - some very scary. hate amlodipine. Weaning off as I write this.

Within the first week of being on 10mg of amlodipine my feet and ankles swelled so bad I could not fit in my shoes. I was always exhausted. Dropping to 5mg helped with the swelling and fatigue but the physical side effects were not the worst part of it. Since starting amlodipine I have become anxious almost the point of being agoraphobic. I'm irritable. Some days I want to crawl out of my own skin.

My dr told me about the side effects but I’m 37 years old and didn’t want a heart attack so I agreed. 10mg/day. Wasn’t ready for what followed. Horrible stomach pain lasting days. Diarrhea, gas pains then constipation. Always cold. Each day at 8pm I would shake uncontrollably even in a warm home. Weak, confused, tired, drained all day. At 2 months my feet got so sore I couldn’t walk no matter how much I rested or kept them up. My skin crawled like an itch I couldn’t scratch. Zero energy for hobbies or activities. At 3 months I began needing to urinate every 30 minutes after bed. If I got to sleep I had the most unpleasant dreams. Talked to dr about concerns but he blamed the beta blocker and lowered that instead. Side effects continued until I had enough. I’m now on day 3 off Amlodipine.

Then the anxiety started to pick up after year 1.  Then by about 18 months in, I was REALLY anxious.  Couldn't sleep, couldn't concentrate.  I noticed muscle tics all the time, heart palpitations, more joint pains, memory loss and more.  Dr. Google helped feed this obsession and I had myself convinced I had contracted some fatal condition (ALS, MS, etc...).  After every specialist I could find, we decided it was anxiety.  Then one day I read someone's account of anxiety and amlodipine.  I asked my cardiologist and we decided to try a switch.  Today I am back to my old self.  Even better because I added those other coping habits in.  
I write this not because amlodipine is bad.  BUT, if you're like me and a few years in and dealing with anxiety, switch it out.  Don't wait as long as I did.  It's not a hard drug to move off of and onto something else.”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking Norvasc for probably 30 years.  The first 20, the drug worked to lower my blood pressure well.  In the last ten years, I've been plagued with scorching legs.  It has literally ruined my life.  Doctors never even had a clue and I never thought it was Norvasc that was hurting me until I had trouble a week ago getting the prescription filled I was out of for 4 days.  On the 4th day without taking it, my legs were feeling pretty good.  I got my prescription refilled took the pill and the next day, I was back to debilitating pain.  I haven't taken it since.  I am now feeling pressure in my head as I've always been prone to migraine headaches.  I never got one after I started taking Norvasc.  I think I'll take the migraines.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking this drug amlodipine at 5mg for moderate hypertension. (72 year old male).  It has certainly brought my BP down and now it is consistently in the 120/75 range.  However there are side effects.  It massively reduced my libido and made me feel tired.  My tendency to have ectopic heart beats (palpitations) has dramatically and disturbingly increased.  I have some leg muscle pain and very rapid  tiredness in the legs on brisk walking and climbing.   For the last month I have been taking a half dose (2.5 mg by cutting pill in half) and the side effects are considerably reduced (but not absent).  My blood pressure remains in the same low range.  I have also experimented taking a quarter dose of 1.25 mg but noticed my BP creeping up again.  
On the high dose (5mg) it significantly reduced my migraine headache problem but much less so on 2.5 mg.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After a 24 hour blood pressure test, it turns out I have mild hypertension. Was afraid to take but started taking 2.5mg before bed. I can't get over how amazing I feel now! I had no idea a small rise in blood pressure can make a person feel so bad. I practically leap out of bed in the morning. I have so much energy now.  I did have some swelling in my ankles before but it is completely gone! I read this was good for migraines. I don't get them that often and hope this medicine prevents them too.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My wise and cautious doctor tried 4 different blood pressure medicines in past 2 yrs. Finally amlodopine worked, it brings my blood pressure down quickly. I decided to write this review because I read others that said their BP went down but did not stay down.  My doc fixed that by giving me 2 doses a day.  I take one at bedtime and one after breakfast. It's working great.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was only on Amlodipine  (lowest dose)for a couple of weeks and began fighting severe constipation.  Stool softeners, enemas could not keep me from finally getting a blocked bowel after a week without any of the above helping. I also had swelling in my ankles and feet and legs and stomach from water retention, something I had controlled with a low salt diet, but could not control it on this medicine.  Also, started having foot and leg cramps after 3 weeks on it. At the 6 weeks date, I had such terrible foot and leg cramps, I was yelling with pain for probably 20 minutes and my feet were curled to one side so I could not stand to walk it out.  I am off it and all the above symptoms are gone.  I will never take it again for any reason.  I have never been more miserable than on this medication.”",1

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“DREADFUL,  FLUSH IT!  After taking amlodipine I first noticed a grey red rash on chest, neck and forearms (should've know my body was rejecting it). Next, gradual increase in Peripheral neuropathy symptoms symptoms including frequent numbness, burning, twitching, and noticeable muscle loss left leg and other paresthesias ( I believed I was in the throes of some awful neurological disease).  I hope others suffering will read this, because within 24 hours of stopping this med, I'm already feeling much better. Sadly I will likely have some permanent damage, but at least I stopped before I became worse. It's a CRIME that patients are ignored when they complain about side effects. Big Pharma take notice!”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,“Norvasc caused extreme leg and ankle edema and did not improve hypertension much.

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,“I hate Norvasc! It made my blood pressure worse. I was always borderline with my blood pressure. It didn't help that I work nights and my diet isn't the greatest. My doctor wanted to me try this medication for a month to see if my blood pressure would lower. Within a week my blood pressure which usually hovers at 140/80 with a pulse of 80 shot to a ridiculous 200/98 with a pulse of 98. My blood pressure will always spike around the evening. My anxiety worsened and I got headaches. This medication does not work for me and I am not going to be tricked into staying on it longer.”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking the 2.5mg dosage of amlodipine for 4 months. The first month, I experience no side effects and pressure went from 140/80 to 124/70.  By month 2, my vision became a little blurry and my osteoarthritis worsened in my back and fingers. I am still trying to work through this with exercise and massage. My doctor thinks I should stay with it a little longer. I actually felt better with the high blood pressure!”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have only been on this at 5mg for a week and the side effects are terrible. You feel like your walking around with sun burn your face is so hot, also my whole  body was really hot. For the last 3 nights suffered greatly with leg cramps and lower back pain day and night. I have also been up through the night with a feeling of uneasy breathing and food coming back up in my throat, and heart burn resulting in having to take extra nexium  which is an unprescribed extra dose and feeling really very unwell.  This medication may work for some people but it most definitely is not for me. I decided to stop taking it as from today to get my life back.”",1
Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am a 65 year old female. Suffered from high BP was put on 5 mg  amlodipine.
I am feeling great on this medication with no side effects.
The only positive side effect is that I do NOT wake up with a headache anymore in the morning because of a blocked nose on one side. My headaches in the past were really really bad in the morning but went away whilst walking around and drinking tea. 
Now no more blocked nose, no
More headaches because the blood flows more easily through the veins that is what I read. I am very happy with this medication and BP back to normal what is not to like.”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,“I've only been on Norvasc for a week and so far the only side effect is difficulty falling asleep and waking up periodically through the night. I know its the Norvasc since I work a very early shift and am generally exhausted by the time its ready for bed. If it continues I'll look into switching medications. However the first blood pressure medication I was on has a worse side effect. Uncontrollable coughing. I had to stop taking it after about a month.”,1
Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I recently went up to 10mg once a day of norvasc. Still does NOT help BP
I have other medical conditions so I am not sure what side effects are from what conditions and other Meds. What I do know, is now i have crazy swelling in my hands legs and feet. It got so bad in my feet I could barely walk anymore. Even though it's not listed as a side effect I it feels like my whole body is swollen

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“Norvasc worked fantastic for about a year then I started experiencing muscle twitching and cramps that got worse and worse. I have been trying to switch to another medicine and haven't had much luck. I pray I can find a medicine as good as Norvasc. I can tell you that numerous blood tests have been run and while this medicine MAY cause cramps, my blood sugar, cholesterol, liver panel, metabolic panel, CBC, creatinine, etc. are all perfect! I have a lot of faith to the fact that this medicine will not harm you other than possibly muscle cramps or fluid retention. I experienced no fluid retention BUT I exercise.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I had been taking 10 mg of Amlodopine for close to 3 years. I had a lot of familial issues going on so the side effects I was initially experiencing I chalked them up to my body being overly stressed. Fast forward to October 2018 after several ER visits for chest pain and left arm weakness I realized it was the medicine. I have been having horrible nightmares for the past 3 years as well where I am woken up out of my sleep and usually my teen comes running in my room to check on me because I wake them up as well.  I have experienced severe anxiety which I never had anxiety issues before, heart palpitations (that had me thinking maybe I had A-Fib), leg swelling and left leg weakness/discomfort especially when I try to lay on my left side at night. I stopped taking Amlodopine the end of October and switched back to Hctz. Some side effects have lessened and I'm hoping they eventually completely go away. This drug was HORRIBLE for me!!!!”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am 4 and a half months in on 2.5 mg once daily for high blood pressure.
Was doing great, blood pressure was controlled and as a bonus, it also pretty much stopped my migraines altogether. I was happy to think my blood pressure was controlled on the smaller 2.5 mg dose than the usual 5 mg. However, into month 3, I noticed I was developing sore, aching muscles. First legs, then arms, then ankles, wrists, neck, hips and back. Each day felt like I had been hit with these deep, aching pains and extreme fatigue. I road this out thinking I could have a virus/summer flu bug. It never dissipated. I then decided to half my dosage. I am on day two of splitting my 2.5 mg pill into 1.25 (half). The first day, no aches. Today, no aches. Fatigue is definitely down a notch.  I am riding this out on 1.25 mg's until I can get in and see my doctor. Under the ""rare or extreme"" side effects listed, muscle pain/joint pain are listed. I don't think this is as rare as they say.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've had high bp, in the 140-160/90-100 range for a number of years, stubbornly refusing to take medication, as I eat a healthy, low-salt diet, and exercise regularly. However, the high numbers persisted, and my current doctor told me I need to take something. She gave me this, at 10mg a day, and I reluctantly tried it. Well, to my amazement, my numbers were down to the 120/80 range almost immediately, with zero side effects!  And that I get it free at the local Public, only makes it better.

Turns out I am Allergic to every medicine I’ve tried for BP. Tried Linsinipral and Omasartan and both caused a horrible cough that would basically gag me. Went on 5mg of Amlodipine that at first worked. Added Spirolactone as a diuretic. After several weeks developed muscle and joint pain and neuropathy in my feet and fingers. Stopped the Spirolactone, but the tingling fingers and feet plus numbness still persists. Even while asleep my arms constantly having pins and needle feelings. Lowered Amlodipine dose to 2.5 and even then cut that in half. As I type this my ears are ringing and have been all day. Even having ear pain (like an infection is coming on) and weird salivary gland tingling which I have never experienced in life (I can eat sour/vinegar foods with no issues).
Both cardiologists I’ve seen believe in plant based eating as much as possible to eliminate the need for taking BP medicines at all.”","

I have two slight side effects. The first is that my hands go numb very easily. The second is that I am sleepy all the time. I used to sleep 5 hours a night. Now I sleep 8 hours a night and it isn't enough. I have to take a nap on lunch every day. On a positive note, I had suffered from migraines weekly for over 20 years. Since I stared Amlodipine 3 months ago, I haven't had a single migraine. It may not be a perfect drug, but I can assure you it is much better than the 3 I tried before it.”","

I prayed that these symptoms would let up after a night's rest. Couldn't sleep because of the migraine and was still nauseous even in my sleep. Woke up this morning and I still feel like a zombie. I don't feel like my life is mine. It feels like I'm living in a cloud, and this is the worst feeling I've ever felt. Doc said, ""Oh I probably should've started you off at a lower dose,"" and that I'll probably feel this way for 2-3 more days. I am so anxious that these side effects won't go away, because I've never had a medication affect my brain this horribly before. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION.

My left side of my throat and jaw stay mostly numb even 2 days off.  If you are seeking advice on high blood pressure just watch your sodium intake.

When I was awake, I had absolutely no energy or enthusiasm. I had no idea what was happening. I reached out to the Doctor via email for help, She actually suggested I might need psychiatric help.

During one episode, the nurse (though well-intended) panicked and kept taking readings (about 10 in a row no breaks) which caused me great distress. She ran through to the doctor's office next door and without seeing me he prescribed this drug. I took the drug as prescribed and it led to rapid pulse a pounding heart and panic attacks for 4 days. When I returned to the doctor's  surgery I saw the doctor (a different one) who listened to my concerns, took my readings which and took me off the drug (it takes a month to wear off and lessens each week). She also looked at the earlier readings and said they were elevated but did not need a drug and that lifestyle changes could help at this point. I took her advice and have lowered my blood pressure to a normal range for 2 years now. I still get white coat hypertension  find that medical teams don't always allow for it.

I was referred to a neurologist who said the causes were from lupus and sent me to a another dr. Who prescribed Plaquinal I continued to have the same problems only worse. Then prednisone was added worse symptoms. BP was good but I was not. So I tapered off and stopped all meds except Amlodopine but became worse not better.

I was then put on this calcium channel blocker, Amlodipine. In short, it brought my BP down to the range of 140/95 for 2 weeks consistently. So that part worked. However and consistent with the other reviews, I literally had swelling of both ankles after the 5th day of taking it. I also felt very, very anxious and just not there so to speak. In light of the severe ankle swelling, I was told to get off of it immediately. I did so, and the swelling went down and I feel normal again. Downside, BP is up again. So I guess we really need to use trial and error and figure out what works best for us individually and what has the least amount of side effects. Will try something else.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have had high blood pressure for over five years and this includes treatment with numerous medication and supplements.  Two months ago I was prescribed Amlodipine for high blood pressure, I had headaches and dizziness with being physically tired.  Today I do not have the headaches, but occasionally experience dizziness if I move fast, or get up from setting, or lying down.  Usually only last a few minutes at a time, but I must sincerely and happily let those who read these comments that this medication works.  My blood pressure even on other medications such as Atenolol did not work as good, my blood pressure was normally between 140 and 150 everyday.  Today it is hitting below 120/70 regularly and usually in the low 100/60 or lower.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“The only side effect I really experienced was extreme drowsiness. The first night I took it, it knocked me out and I slept all night. Waking up the next morning was a challenge because I was still so drowsy. But that only lasted for one night. I experienced minor nausea after eating one meal. That's about it for the side effects. It did lower my blood pressure dramatically though. Overall, I'm having a great experience with this.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“My doctor gave me 10mg amlodipine prescribed dose to take along with another blood pressure medication. Then started the headaches which did subside. Then heart rate slowed way down after about 3-4 months from 75 beats a minute to as low as 44! Then preceding that I started getting excruciating leg muscle pains in my left leg along with terrible hip joint pain as well as knee and ankle pain. At times I was limping like an old man. My doctor noticed my swollen ankles and said it was a known side effect of the amlodipine and prescribed a diuretic which did remove the swelling but with a cost! I was nauseated and could hardly eat and my hip pain and joint pain remained. I decided neither was worth the cost of my comfort so I have stopped the diuretic and reduced the amlodipine to 5mg. The muscle and hip pain and nausea stopped after a few days but the knee joint still slightly aches. I’m going to stop taking the amlodipine soon and after reading the terrible side effects of amlodipine.”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on Amlodipine for several years in addition to a diuretic and ARB for high blood pressure.  Although it does lower blood pressure slightly, its main effect to me was to cause swelling of my ankles and feet.  That became entirely unacceptable to me a couple of months ago.  The edema was so bad that bending my ankles was uncomfortable.  Upon stopping the drug, I can once again see my ankles and the veins of my feet.  I cannot believe that a drug that produces one of the side effects of congestive heart failure can be a good drug.  I am never taking it again.”","

I knew something was drastically wrong and stopped it cold turkey. Within 24 hours I had no dizziness, my energy was better. By day 2, no pressure behind the eyes. I'm sure experiences vary depending on your body chemistry, but this stuff was killing me a day at a time. Hope your experience is better than mine, but I'd encourage you to listen to your body.”","

My blood pressure stays on 185 over  95 even with blood pressure meds. Sleeping is a nightmare and I heard that it carries on for 120 days after leaving the drug.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on this drug amlodipine since Dec. 20. The first thing I noticed was swelled up ankles and sometimes hands. Then I noticed at work my arms were getting fatigued when I was holding something light like the mail. A day after my legs started feeling the same. I was constantly wanting to sit down. In the mornings I would feel a racing heart, and during the days it was hard for me to focus. I am only 24 years old and have high bp from being overweight and being a heavy drinker. I have stopped drinking around the 1st of January and started dieting but still to this day have all the side effects. I also noticed only a 5-7 point change in BP which makes the side effects so not worth it. This is a terrible drug, my cardiologist prescribe it to me through online messenger. After reading everyone's experiences I can't believe he was willing to just put me on 10mg from the start. I also take metoprolol and lisinopril (have been for 6-8 months) and am lucky enough to have no side effects from those.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My doctor prescribed Atenolol 50m for my high blood pressure.
I then had a new doctor that thought my blood pressure was still too high and prescribed Amlodipine. As soon as I started taking it,
I had side effects; swelling of the ankles and feet: I woke up each morning with a massive headache at my brain stem( I've had headaches, but never there).  I took the medication 6 hours before, my blood pressure was rising fast (188/92). I called my doctor immediately. I got a different doctor in the office and told me to stop taking amlodipine and to take 50m of my former medicine, Atenolol. My blood pressure went down and the other doctor gave me a new prescription for Atenolol and I have been fine ever since with no side effects. I wrote this so if you are having problems with Amlodipine, be your own advocate. It is not the only blood pressure medication for high blood pressure.

I've been to the emergency  room 6 times, to a neurologist, a cardiologist,  an ENT a gastroenterologist,  and to my gp and had dozens of tests, MRI, CT scan, EGD, blood work, EEG. Urinalysis all of it it has destroyed  4 months of my life. I finally  put the pieces together. It all began  after  I began this  drug. I have had my cardiologist  take me off 3 days ago. I can't wait for it to leave my system. This has been horrible!”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After stopping this drug for 20 days I still have leg/hip/groin pain on left side when standing.  Laying down is fine but as soon as I stand up the pain shoots through my hips, groin and thigh.   Does anybody know when these side affects will go away if ever.  I have to take Tylenol or Excederin to help with the pain and this can’t be good either.  Do not take this if at all possible.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I switched to amlodipine after dry cough from lisinoprel. Cough decreased in frequency but still persists years later. On amlodipine I really went downhill, severe joint pain every joint is affected and leg and ankle swelling are really terrible. Achy all the time most especially in low back and legs to the point I simply can not walk anymore. I take a few steps and the legs ache so bad they lock up and I must rest to take another step. Eventually I get home but really I can't even walk anymore and have gained weight and flab.losartan is not lowering my bp and I really feel death would be a kinder more desirable event. Who wants to live with this chemical straight jacket 24/7? The fatigue is so constant I look forward to going to bed.”","

These all went away once i stop taking this medicine -  please stay away from it.”",1
Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“At first I was becoming dizzy and had a couple of huge heart fluttering, however they soon stop after about a week.
I am very satisfied with Amlodipine, it was the only medication that made a different with my high blood pressure. Amlodipine lowered my blood pressure about ten to twenty points, and today I am still taking this medication. Mostly in the evening, late at night just before bed to have it fully in my system by morning.
        This is a potent medication and I am only on 10mg tabs, once a day. For me this stuff really works, and does what it supposed to do, my biggest concern are Generic Drugs.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was borderline high blood pressure during a check up and the doctor started me at 10mg amlopidine right away. Took 3 days for side effects to kick in, but they've landed me in the hospital for two stays. It causes electrical haywire, tightness, palpitations, you name it. I tried to stop cold turkey, and that landed me in the hospital yet again with sky high blood pressure. Doctor prescribed atenolol, 25mg, as a sidekick medicine and it smoothed over most of the haywire effects. The problem is now I am on two of these bad boys and it's ridiculously hard to get off them without feeling like you're going to have a stroke. I'm trying to sort out how to wean myself down and get off this hot mess. Given a choice, I would take atenolol over this stuff hands down. Improved diet and exercise is by far the best option. I dread the suffering and probable hospital stay it's going to take to get off this nasty in the coming weeks. Think carefully before you ever get involved with it.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“Amlodopine is a dangerous drug. It attacks the muscles in the body and weakens them. I was told by Dr to go into a wheelchair. I realized since on amlodopine my life . I started experiencing terrible pain in my hips and muscles. It became so bad that I couldn't lift one leg or foot to take a step. My hips locked into place and my marriage caved. I did a  review of the medications I take and found amlodopine does weaken the muscles and it's banned in some countries. I stopped the amlodopine by cutting down to nothing over 5 weeks. I had chest pains throughout until 6 weeks later they were gone. The worst was that my blood pressure ran out of control. I thought this is it often. Then I started having even worse withdrawal symptoms besides my blood pressure reeking havoc though my Dr had given me additional no tablets. The worst headaches and spasms”,1

Stopped taking and noticed no further extreme fatigue ..blood pressure has crept up, will try to controls with exercise. Will go see my physician”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“38 y/o with high blood pressure. Have been taking Amlodopine for about 3-4 years.  Blood pressure off meds was 180/110. On 10MG of Amlodopine and reducing sodium intake/ caffeine, I am down to 110/78. Great improvement. Now the side effects: The biggest one I've noticed over the 3 years is a  decline in sexual desire and function.  It didn't happen over night, but a slow decline. While they say Amlodopine is not likely to cause these issues, further studies show large testosterone drops in rats with long term use. I am fairly certain its the meds, dropped dosage to 2.5mg for 1 week to test and there was a notable return of function and desire, but BP way too high. Told doctor, just wants to give me Viagra. No thanks. But its a double edged sword because high BP also will cause issues, so meds aren't optional.  In my experience Amlodopine caused these issues after long term use.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm currently on  Amlodipine 5mg tab- The first 72-96 hours on this medication were very rough-very severe headaches, palpitations, dizziness, etc.  After the 3rd day, the headaches subsided and by the 5th day they were gone.   BP had been elevated due to non-tolerance from previous med combo.  By the end of the 1st week BP was down into the 120s over 80s.  So far I have been using this med for just over one month without any major side effects other than slight water retention leading to slight swelling of hands and ankles. My weight has remained steady.  

The med worked for me and I am glad as I had been trying so many different types of med to control BP that I was starting to lose hope.”","

I have been so exhausted yes I’m a new mom with two children so it’s to be expected but so tired that I’ve been sleeping every nap my baby has and babies sleep almost 16+ hours a day.

The following week, I took no migraine medication (Imitrex) or OTC meds at all - even though we had two days when I would normally have had weather-related issues, and I played tennis on another day. I did have swollen feet the first few days, but I increased my water intake and that seems to be the key for me. So far I'm very impressed with the results.”",1

I would get very tired in the afternoon.  My doctor increased the medication and I wound up not being able to stand when I got out of bed.  I decided to stop taking it for a few days.

I never thought it was caused by this medication  and saw several doctors, had many test all negative they tried many other medication with so many side effects, some even putting me in ER room. After doing a lot of research on line and getting no where with all the doctors three RA doctors and several other types of doctors I was forced to retire as I was unable to walk to far, or lift up my arms as I had so much pain that  I was unable to sleep. I found something on line about drug induced lupus.  I stopped medication and in 2 days I stop vomiting and by the 5 day most of the joint pain was gone. After a month I  was able to lay on my side my hips were not in pain anymore, the sores on my eye lids had stopped,my hands no longer were in pain.

I told my doctor that I had quit because I was unhappy, and he said that he was very happy and that I needed help for moderately high blood pressure. I then suggested that HE try amlodipine.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“On 10 mg of Amlodopine for high blood pressure. It controls the BP but without question it causes sexual dysfunction. Not just ED, but overall lack of desire and sensitivity. I suspect the cause is lower testosterone as a result of the drug. Cialis works for the ED, but doesn't fix the sensitivity nor the lack of desire. I was convinced it was something else causing the issue, perhaps the high BP itself. But 5 days off the medicine and its like night and day. Take the medicine, and the problems return. Doctor seems unconcerned about this issue since ""you have to be on meds to control your BP so not much I can do but write the Cialis script"". I am only 39.

I, too, had some strong side effects on (1) 10mg or (2) 5mg daily.  Swollen ankles were worst,, but nausea, tiredness, etc were culprits too.  I asked my doctor what the smallest pill (mg) was.  It is 2.5.  I started using 4 in a day, but spreading them out.  In other words, a 2.5 pill at 7am, 12pm, 5pm and 10pm (or approximate times spread out).  I now actually only take 3 pills (7.5 total), but still spread them out.  For me, it still has the right effect of bringing down the BP, but the side effects are dispersed out so they are MUCH more manageable.  I sit in a soft chair or use the recliner to reduce ankle swelling.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“At first, it's quite effective - and significantly does - to lower blood pressure. It has few side effects, and works within 30min-1.5hrs. The only downside is that it can take 6-8hrs to achieve the full drop, and tolerance develops shortly - about 4 months - after taking it regularly. It's a good step above diuretics, but it's not enough by itself. In addition it's fantastic to prevent migraines; Combining it with Lisinopril is much better than Amlodipine alone.”","

Would get at least 1 a week that was manageable but very few weeks one that was horrendous and every 6 months 1 that would leave me stuck In bed all day wiped out and all my nervous system was on edge. Felt like my senses were all over the place not even able to focus on opening a door handle. 

Started taking Amlodipine 8 weeks ago and realised today I’ve not had a single migraine.  No visual disturbances or other aura issues either.  Minimal occasional headache that goes away without any need for pain relievers. 

Glad that this medication has another effect. I suspected this would be the case as it widens the blood vessels and one of my consultants suggested my migraines were caused when the blood vessels contract causing the Migraine.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I am a 62 male, served as a fireman for 33 years, and suffered with migraine at least two a week from the age of 21. Mine being related to food, alcohol, vinegar etc. Has been hell for years. I have tried all the so called preventative medicines to no avail, but managed to control them with Imigran. Last year I was prescribed Amlodipine 5mg for slightly high blood pressure. To my amazement my migraine has stopped completely. So I have gone from two a week to zero! Life changing to say the least. I now enjoy alcohol, pizza, cheese, vinegar, chocolate ! Hope this helps someone to live a normal life.”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on this med for more than ten years and find it quick acting and effective. All BP meds have side effects. I take nebivolol, norvasc and telmisartan, the latter two maximum dosage. I'm 78, male.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Hi. I just started this amlodipine 4 days ago and since I started I’ve had this gnawing pain in my stomach. Never had it before so I can only attribute it to this drug but I’m only on 2.5 mg.
I don’t know if it’s going to be worth staying on this unless the stomach ache stops. I’ve had to use an ice pack on my stomach because of the discomfort I guess I’m wondering if after 4 days can you just stop taking it I know if you’re on it for a considerable amount of time you have to be careful but it’s only been 4 days. 
We’ve tried a few different medications but I have side effects to  the blood pressure meds and the only time my blood pressure is really elevated as when I go to my doctors appointment at home it’s not that bad.  This was a last ditch effort to try a BP Med.  I much rather just make a few lifestyle changes which I’ve already done but they say that you still may need a medication even with changes”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“15 days on amlopidine 5mg, the last 6 I cut it down to 2.5.
I did it because I was having many symptoms that scare me, flushing, sleepiness, pounding heart , palpitations felt on neck , muscle twitching, reflux.   Since I am on 2.5 the reflux lessened a little, and also pounding heart, feeling some palpitations about once in the day, but now I feel something in the skin all over from time to time.  Asking dr on Monday to take me off the pill.  But I am worried because I read that it needs to be wean off because there have been people that had worst symptoms  even heart attack after stopping them abruptly.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was just prescribed Norvasc, for my high blood pressure.  I've always had low blood pressure, but my Rheumatoid Arthritis Doc put me on prednisone and the result was high blood pressure.  Hence, Norvasc.  I was prescribed 5 mg., and the first day of taking it, and every day since,  I have had major heart palpitations.  Not a nice feeling.  I also feel WIRED.  So far, not liking this medication at all!  Why do medications, to treat illness and symptoms, bring an entirely new set of problems?”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking Amlodipine for about 3 years now, I also have MS so some of the side effects I have been having I put down to MS.  I  have been under the hospital for really bad tongue and mouth ulcers, for the last 2.5 years and also under the hospital for a badly bloated stomach, I look like I am 7 or 8 months pregnant, (both side effects) all tests have come back ok. My balance is terrible and recently had two bad falls in a week! I have constant ringing in my ears, cramp in my feet at night, feel tired and have to have a sleep most afternoons,  Swollen feet and ankles. Researching the side effects of Amlodipine has made me realise all these symptoms are probably due to this awful drug.  Will be seeing doc next week to get it changed”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This medication has many side effects and I think that I had them all. Redness of the face, swelling of ankles and hands, severe knee pain, nausea to name a few. My left knee had so much fluid I had it aspirated three times and not one Doctor said a word. I read some posts and decided to stop taking it and I felt better in a few days and my knee doesn't hurt. 5mgs of poison every morning......”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was started on 2.5mg a day. Within 2 days my BP raised significantly. The dosage was increased to 5mg, again a large rise in BP. Another increase to 10mg day and BP skyrocketed with whole body swelling. 2 days off amlodipine and BP is close to normal”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Following a massive BP spike and a history of high blood pressure I started on 5mg three weeks ago. From day one I had a blinding debilitating headache but, on a positive, my bp was dropping. Second week headache eased but chest & stomach pain, leg cramps, left leg swelling, fatigue & dizziness became increasingly worse. After three blackout falls (two very badly),  the doctor advised me to stop immediately. Three days off it and now no pains & steadier but have worrying arrythmia. To its credit it has dropped my BP. 
I was happy to take it and ride out any side effects but the impact was too great for me. Clearly this medicine does work for some though. Lifestyle, diet & careful consideration to any meds.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was on this for about 2 years, 10 mg/day. It was clearly causing my legs to swell, but nevertheless, I persisted. Eventually, the elephant legs were too much for me to take, so I stopped the amlodipine, cold turkey. I lost 8 pounds of water over the next few days and low and behold, blood pressure went way, way down! I hit as los as 109/59, which prompted me to stop another BP med, losartan, which turned out to have been causing my chronic leg pain! I am now only on chlorthalidone, with a bp a bit high at 135/82, not sure which way to go next. Maybe try cutting salt. If you get the elephant legs from amlodipine,  maybd cut the dose or cut out the drug, try a different way to lower BP.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Extremely dizzy , lightheaded and bouts of vertigo. Insomnia was common and with having all those symptoms came a kind of depression from feeling like the world was spinning 24/7. But my BP was under control!

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Have been taking Amlodipine for 4 days now. After first day felt fine, second day had a panic attack on the train to work, shook me to the core and haven't felt right since. Fluttering heartbeat, feeling nervous and anxious for no reason, feeling like I'm not totally in my body or in the moment. Woke up at 4am and had a mild panic attack and couldn't sleep for another hour. Ringing in ears and tingling fingers and toes. Taking this with perindopril combi 5mg, have NEVER had any adverse reaction to previous blood pressure medication. I'm so scared to keep taking this medication, thought I was imagining things until I researched and found many, many others similar and worse reactions. Have scheduled doctor appointment to change meds. I'm 20&F”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After GP visit he said my BP was slightly high age 50. Put me on 5mg amlodipine, that was 6 weeks ago, horrible nightmares, swollen hands and feet.Tinnitus which is unbearable, told the effects would wear off stick with it.4 weeks in got what I thought was flu, badly congested chest to the point couldn't speak without losing breath.
A week ago, fast heart like my heart was trying to punch its way out of my chest. Ended up in A@E, fast tachy, heavy chest, arm pains, symptoms of a heart attack.
Stopped now for three days. Irregular beats now subsiding, and feeling a little better. Panic attacks like you wouldn't believe and it's down to this drug, should be banned, Now having to wait another 9 days as it stays in your system for 11-15 days minimum.GP denied any of the symptoms were down to this drug, it is! So now waiting to see my EP who did my successful ablation for AF years ago to see if it's undone any of his good work.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have advised my doctor that I have now stopped taking Amlodipine.  I was prescribed it 5 years ago but have always believed my high blood pressure readings were only when stressed out or at the doctors and now I am convinced that I am right.   I have had nightmare problems with frequent urination, sometimes 6 times an hour and on a good day, every two hours (good days are exceptional)   I can only bathe once a week as my skin is so itchy its unbearable.  I now get extreme dizzy spells and although I will be 70 this year I still feel hot flushes as if I am in the menopause.   This medication has been like poison to me.  No one really believed me until I spoke to the practice nurse and she totally agreed that I should come off it and gave the doctor the readings I had taken with my own bp monitor which, although I had stopped it over two weeks before, was completely normal (in some readings as low as 60 )  trust your own judgement.  I feel it has stolen the last five years from me...”",1
Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was on 5 mg of Lisinopril for many years with no issues until blood work revealed some kidney issues (which Lisinopril can cause)  My MD took me off Lisinopril. BP was ok for a while but started creeping up. I was prescribed 5 mg of Amlodipine a week ago. This medication is making me feel awful; I am tired and unmotivated I actually feel depressed (well that makes sense if it slows the heart rate) I have also experienced  constipation which is not something I’m willing to deal with. I called the MD’s  office today and  nurse advised me to discontinue, which  I will gladly do! I am very sensitive to medication so this is probably not typical. I hope they can find something else or just put me back on Lisinopril and monitor me closely”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm 55 and 195 lbs. Was on 5mg Norvasc after repeated BP readings of 160+/80. Norvasc brought my BP down to 140/80 for the first 3 months.  Then I started getting heart palpitations. I would also start feeling flushed & dizzy. It became progressively worse to the point I couldn't stand because of my dizziness. Heart palpitations occurred frequently.  Doctor took blood, EKG and also did two stress tests. All were negative (BP went back up to 165/75 - on average).

I stopped taking Norvasc after 6 months, Doctor put me on 10mg Lisinopril.  As my diet improved over the past 6 months (I have always done cardio), I stopped any BP meds.  It been 24 days and my BP (which I take several times a day) hovers between 120/75 to 141/82. I'm no longer dizzy or feel flush.  Still get heart palpitations every few hours that hasn't fully been explained.  Bottom line is (IMO), I can do without meds by having changed my diet (which was good to start with - Just needed to make some adjustments).”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was put on it for high blood pressure and got terrible pains in my legs. I then started to get brown staining on my legs. Every doctor I saw said they did not know what it was and could not be a side effect of the tablet. It is I'm truly angry, my legs are a mess and the NHS no longer does veins so I ha ve been told any treatment to correct this I will have to pay for. Shame on the company and shame on those who let this terrible drug get licenced for use. Thank god I am off it but I think the makers need to sort out the consequences of this drug. I have to live with this! The company and those who prescribe this drug are making loads of money..... I on the other hand am left with disgusting legs.... So eone needs to put this right!”",1
Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on Amlodipine for 1 week now and here is what I have started experiencing: occasional double vision, some hip pain, and a very serious nightmare. I was sound asleep when all of a sudden my throat felt like I was having the worst case of acid reflux I have ever had and I could not catch my breath; I immediately came upright because I could not breath; the feeling immediately went away but there was no indication that acid reflux had occurred (no terrible taste in my throat, no soreness) so I assume it was a very realistic nightmare, but the fact I could not breath seemed very real.  I'm not sure I want to continue taking this drug. Sometimes I feel like a guinea pig for pharmaceutical companies.”","

For the past month, I'm exhausted, dull nagging headache, general malaise, shortness of breath, lethargic, gained 5 lbs.

My blood pressure is borderline high from anxiety 135:86 usually, but when I get real anxious it goes way up to about 150/110. I have tried lisinopril in the past with the best results. This time around my doctor tried me on norvasc 5mg. As soon as I started taking it my blood pressure went up, my feet and ankles swelled and I got headaches. I also had a bad panic attack and my blood pressure went sky high. It didn’t control it whatsoever. I haven’t taken it today or yesterday so I went to the grocery to take my bp to see what it was. My kids were fighting so I assumed it was going to be high and it was actually better than it’s been in a few weeks. Don’t recommend this medication.  I also get migraines and this is supposed to prevent them as well and it made my head hurt.”","

My blood pressure was crazy high like 220/119 stroke level, and now after the medication it's around 157/99.

Blood with the urine lasted until Friday. (I noticed a few small flecks of red on Friday, too.) A higher bp reading due to stress had led to the doctor prescribing  this extra prescription.  One of my stressors is white coat syndrome. Now, he wants me to visit a urologist. My other side effects were less output of urine and less frequent urination.  I had 3 loose stools on Thursday.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Took this drug for high blood pressure. Started out on hydrochlorothiazide but had a lot of side effects from it. Then switched over, took it one night and only got 4 hours of sleep. Next day I took my blood pressure and it was insanely high. Highest blood pressure reading I've had. I went to urgent care and they suggested I go to the ER. At the ER they did a lot of tests and couldn't find anything. 48 hours after taking amlodipine blood pressure still hasn't gone down. If I could give this drug a negative reading I would. Stay clear of amlodipine. Highly don't recommend.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I began taking this amlopidine for high blood pressure about a year ago. It worked fine for several months til I started having swelling and pain in my feet and legs. I was having some attacks of gout and thought that was it that causing the problem but the pain and swelling went on long after the gout. I got to where I could hardly walk. My wife noticed that swelling was a side effect. I quit the medicine immediately, and noticed a huge difference within a week. I have been off the medicine for 3-4 mths, but still have some problems with swelling and pain although not near as severe. I have also have developed knots in my calves while on this medicine that has not went away since stopping the medicine. I fear I have irreversible damage.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was having chest pain so I went to the ER 6 days ago. My blood pressure was 189/107mmg which is very high considering I’m a 31 yo woman. They started me on amlodipine 5 mg once a day. For the first 3 days I had mild symptoms of headache, dizziness and tiredness. The 4th day I felt a rush of pressure in my head, numbness In my face and neck on my right side, anxiety and SEVERE PANIC ATTACKS. Went back to the ER where they said I probably slept wrong and hurt my neck, and I just need to let my body get used to the new meds. They told me to continue taking the med. The panic attack continued over the next two days along with facial numbness, muscle weakness, headache, vivid dreams, insomnia, excessive thirst, twitching in my legs and neck pain. Thank goodness I found this page. I felt like I was going crazy. I’ve decided to stop taking this medication. I do not recommend even though it did help lower my blood pressure. Not worth the side effects. If I could give it a 0 out of 10 I would.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Male, 56 yo. Was having palpitations with lisinopril, so I was switched to 10 mg amlodipine. On 2nd day, had severe reaction (irregular hearbeat, fluctuating BP, lightheaded, etc), ended up in ER. After various tests, docs didn't find anything wrong, but said don't take it anymore. The real fun began later that night. Woke up with severe panic attack that turned into a ""bath salts"" (recreational drug) episode: compulsively waving arms and pacing the floor, twidding fingers and toes, grunting, and finally depersonalization (watching yourself from outside your body). It subsided after 20+ minutes, but had panic/anxiety attacks every day 2 months after. I never had anxiety issues before. 2 years later, and I still have to be careful, as I can't control anxiety when life gets a bit difficult. I switched back to lisinopril + metoprolol, so my BP is back down, without palps. But I occasionally need to take anti-anxiety meds. Others report similar reactions, which 
may be why its banned in some countries.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I’ve been on this medication amlodipine a few months. At first everything was great. Good blood pressure, no side effects. However, about three weeks ago, I started to have awful flushing, (Thinking I may have carcinoid syndrome), fatigue, nausea, and chills.  The chills have been so bad that at times I shake uncontrollably.  I could see my Dr chuckle when I said, “I think I’m having a reaction to the amlodipine.”  After reading stories on this site, I made the executive decision to stop taking this. That was two days ago. I’m feeling only slightly better, but this stuff stays in your system for up to 11 days. It has been like I have the flu. I’m currently hoping for more improvement even as my blood pressure goes up. The trade-off is much better than these side effects. Also, I’ve recently had a clean upper and lower GI scope, so no carcinoid.”","

However, the side effects were terrible: frequent urination, constipation followed 10 minutes later by uncontrollable diarrhea, blurry vision, cough, fatigue  and sleepiness.

When I would go out, I would not take the medicine.  I found out that Amlodipine was causing my problems when I took an airplane flight.  I did not take it because I did not want to go to the bathroom when we were flying.  I didn't take it for 2 days and almost all my symptoms disappeared.  I took it again and all the problems came back so I stopped taking it.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After a TIA I found I had high blood pressure 170/110
In the hospital they gave me something that caused HUGE adverse reactions.  I was then given a brand name sample by my PCP (expensive) that worked but due to price he switched me to the generic equivalent of 2 meds.  We adjusted the dosage of each to find the best for me.  Settled on Amlodipine 10mg and Quinapril 40mg.   Have been taking these for 5+ years with no side effects that I can say are caused by the drugs.  (I experience some of the things reported but know some are caused by other issues I have).   Nothing is serious.   We twice tried to reduce the Quinapril to 20mg but the systolic slowly went up over 2-3 weeks and when it hit 160 I went back to 40mg.  Since I started taking these my BP has been about 134/74 regularly.  I am now 68 years old 175-180 pounds, exercise, and watch my diet.   Works great for me.”","

I almost fainted last Sunday, and again doctors couldn't see what the problem was, though maybe it could be side effects of the amlodipine. The cardiologist shifted me over to enalapril 10mg instead.

Im an active person, and I knew that I hadn't injured both of my ankles at the same time. 1 month later, I went to the Sports medicine doctor who also told me that I had Achilles tendinitis. He sent me to physical therapy for 6 weeks. PT did not help me at all. I googled Achilles tendinitis & amlodipine together. A doctor did a study in 1999 that connected the 2.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed amlodipine after lisinopril hctz and Losartan both caused severe hair loss and insomnia.

After taking a dose, I would experience a severe headache for 20 hours, plus stomach upset.  However, my hair was not falling out, nor did I have insomnia. It took about 2-3 weeks for the headaches and upset stomach to stop completely.It took about 6 weeks for my blood pressure to be in the normal range. No side effects currently.

The only thing I'm not happy about is I haven't been able to lose weight while on Amlodipine, even though I'm strictly dieting. Prior to starting this drug, I had been losing nicely. But I suppose I'd rather be fatter with a full head of hair, than thin and bald. :)”","

On two occasions, the brand of drug was changed and I felt the meds weren't as effective and switched back. In researching, the inactive ingredients were different in the ones I didn't like. The common denominator was adherence to the original formula. Multiple people in my extended family use it without issue as well. I take 10 mg. My ankles have swollen on a few occasions but I'm not sure if it was travel or heat related, both other factors during those times. I took several weeks to adjust to the meds but committing to it was a great decision for me. I didn't want to be on BP meds in my 30s but I feel much better because of it.”",1

Seems my body can handle everything with only slight side effects by doing this. My doctor said he'd never had a patient do it this way, but due to my good effect, has now put several patients on Amlodipine in this manner.  By breaking it up, the body seems to be able to tolerate it well.  May not work for everyone, but for me it was such a blessing.”","

Amlodipine,For Raynaud's Syndrome:,"“I took this for around 2 weeks for my raynauds disease. Now I will say that this did work for me, I wasn't having as many attacks as I used to before taking this med, my hands were actually WARM, which is huge for me because they virtually never are, they're always freezing cold. It did do me wonders for my raynauds, but there's a catch. It made me INCREDIBLY drowsy. I only took half of a 5mg tablet daily. I felt like I couldn't do anything throughout the day, just felt weak. Even though it worked wonders for my raynauds, the drowsiness and weakness was way too much and I stopped taking it all together. I would not let this discourage others with raynauds who are looking into medication to help control it though. Not everybody reacts the same way, so maybe others won't get that intense drowsiness like I did and it ends up working fine and dandy for them.”","

It made me have tachycardia. My heart was speeding at over 200 bpm sitting still. Worse if I got up to walk around or anything like that. I couldn't sleep because it felt like I was running. I would stay in bed propped up (because laying down made it worse) and occasionally drift off when I got so exhausted I couldn't stay awake anymore. This sleep only lasted about an hour at a time before I woke up again. Docs increased the dose saying I just needed to get used to it. It made it worse.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started on 5mg of amlodopine 3 weeks ago following a visit to an out of hours Doctor. At first it did drop my Bp, but after the first week I noticed that when I took my Bp reading at 9:00am it was down to 130/78 (ish), but after taking the medication, and checking my Bp at 2.00pm it was up to 150/100. The same occurred at 8:00pm as well. Then, 4 days ago it shot back up to 185/125 which caused me to end up at the doctors again. The doctor said that he thought my Bp had risen further because I was anxious about my Bp and advised me to stop taking readings for a few days, at least until the weekend. I have, and surprise surprise my Bp today has dropped to a sensible 125/78.
The other thing I’ve noticed is they give me a full headache and they caused my resting heartbeat to rise from 67 to 78 which is very strange as well. I think I’ll be asking my Gp to reassess my treatment as I don’t think this drug works for me.”","

I also have been itching a small dry patch of skin on my back. I'm 37, and work out 2-3 times per week.  My BP is usually around 120-30/90. I'm going to have my doctor switch me to another med.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I don't react well to blood pressure meds. Quick story: I'm 24, Female, overweight (but working on it now) and haven't had an issues with health at all until 3 weeks ago. My norm BP before this issues were around 125/76 (I work at the hospital, I check it often) 3 weeks ago I had chest pains and went to the ER and my BP was 160/103 and ever since Its been about 145/100 with meds when I wake up daily. 

I started off on Metoprolol (I think its called) it helped lower my BP a little going down to 135/85 but the side effects were HORRIBLE. I felt like a zombie, I couldn't focus and almost got into a car accident, My chest pains would come back, I had tingling in my legs right arm and jaw, and eye twitching and spasms. My BP would shoot up.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been prehypertensive for 5 years. Once my BP started to be in hypertensive range, I started taking 5 mg of Amlodipine. It caused severe dizziness, headache , fatigue and drowsiness. I had to go to hospital to rule out MI or and other conditions related to brain. Running drastically reduced my BP to range of 70/40 mm of hg. This medicine has long half life. I stopped Amlodipine”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“Been taking amlodipine for 5 weeks. My ankles are so swollen But it’s the horrendous leg pain & tiredness plus nightmares that made me go back to dr. He’s now put me on a diuretic which I’ve been taking for 5 days now. The pain has eased off a little but still struggling to walk very far. Anyone know how long these side effects will last.”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Glad I found this site. Stopped taking it after 1 pill - face is on fire and cheeks are bright red. Headache and tinnitus. Unable to remember what I was working on. Dry mouth. Just about fell asleep at the keyboard and could not keep my eyes open. All this on a 5mg tablet which my doc told me was a small amount and well tolerated. Took this when Lisinopril gave me a bad dry cough and numb tongue. While the Lisinopril worked within half an hour my pressure actually went UP with this drug. Thank you all for your stories - I am not taking any more. This drug has a REALLY LONG HALF LIFE of up to 50 hours and can take 11 days to get totally out of your system. Since so much is already in your body you are just adding more in when the rest hasn't left yet? It's done this way to make ""convenient dosing"".”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I took Amlodepine for many years.
I'm a young 61 year old business woman who is extremely active.  Suddenly, last June  my abdomen was so swollen on my left side, I couldn't fit into my summer dresses or jeans. My ankles and legs swelled so much (I have pictures). I spent over $5,000 for procedures (and that's just what my insurance didn't pay).  
Cat scan for my stomach mass. PT scan. Numerous doctors for leg swelling... heart palpitations (I wore a heart monitor because my heart was beating too fast- but slowed down while sleeping to 2 seconds per beat) 
I had no idea what was going on.  ENDLESS doctors appointments and treatments!  
  I was also losing my hair. It was falling out in clumps. 
One day ( my doctor advised me to see a cardiologist) and he said "" Why are you on Amlodipine?""  You don't need it. You're blood pressure is good now. 
I stopped taking it. 
In 2 days, the mass on my left side of abdomen was gone. My hair stopped falling out. My legs don't swell anymore”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on 10 mg  amlodipine for high blood pressure for many years, my pharmacy switch to a new provider, manufactured by LUPIN pharma and my blood pressure is no longer stable and I am uncomfortable. I have a stressful occupation and the generic Norvasc was serving me well for over 10 years. I have been on this brand for about 4 months and find this medication questionable. At this point I do not believe this is accomplishing the goal of balancing my blood pressure. 
I recommend you question the use if it does not agree with  you. For me I do not recommend it and have been told its the only brand my pharmacy carries. This causes me concern for me and for others.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started Amolodopine/Besylate in August of 2011.  I switch from lisinopril as I was having severe allergic reactions.  Now I'm on this new medication and I have been feeling unusual at times.  I feel very dizzy, swelling in hands, feet and throat area.  I've had a throat infection and sometimes I feel like I'm limited in my speech.  I'm experiencing tingling in my hands and feet at times.  It's annoying.  My blood pressure is lowering now because I've increased my exercise, but sometimes I'm not able to drive home because of the dizziness.  I've had one crazy episode when I took a multivitamin.  I felt my heart beating so fast and I could literally hear it through my ears.  I was unable to pay attention and was jittery and cold.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Just as the above, my life has been changed as a result of starting on Amlodipine. I was prescribed it for my hypertension, and my migraines have completely disappeared. I suffered migraine three days a week. I mentioned this to my GP and he told me this makes perfect sense. Migraine, I'm told, is a consequence of blood vessels in the head being in spasm and Amlodipine has a 'stabilizing' effect on these blood vessels.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“On Norvasc since 1992.  Started with 5 mg.  After kidney cancer, one kidney removed in 2004, blood pressure slowly rose, now I take 10 mg once a day.  Also tried all generic brands, but the filler in all maintenance medication causes an Adverse Reaction, called Myalgia.  Pain in the groin and upper legs, so must stay on Name Brand, Norvasc.  Now Kidney Disease, Stage 4, blood pressure often rises, usually because I get off my strict diet.  It will go up to 200/100, but generally it stays 134/73.  I am 76 years old, so that 134/76 is a perfect blood pressure for my age, especially with Kidney Disease.  Norvasc has been a life saver for me.”","

Amlodipine,For Raynaud's Syndrome:,"“As I've aged, raynauds episodes have become more severe during winter.  I'm a 59 yr old Male.  I've avoided meds for raynauds, but my symptoms were so severe this winter that I experienced minor tissue damage on the tips of a couple toes and they were so sensitive that I had to soak my feet in hot water, etc., to avoid and reduce pain.  Symptoms went away in my feet immediately with amlodipine,  I still have episodes of the  Raynaud's syndrome with my fingers, but not as severe.  I plan to stop using the medication when the weather warms and start up again next winter.  I may have some slight dizziness in the mornings, but nothing significant.  I take the medication at bedtime (5mg) to help avoid that reported symptom.  I think this is also resulting in fewer migraines this winter.  I'm on day 25 with this med and am very pleased with it so far.  Tissue damage on toes  (dark spots) has cleared as new skin follicles have grown.  Wish I'd tried this sooner and am thankful to my doc for recommending!”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“Been on and off BP meds for many years (I'm 49).  Been taking this for approximately 2 years.  Strangely developed arrhythmia and then last fall started having episodes of Afib.  I guess I've been blindly taking this as well as Olmesartan for even longer.  I underwent an Ablation on my heart at the first of May this year.  Haven't had one issue with the arrhythmia or afib until I stopped taking my Amlodipine 2 days ago.  This morning I woke up and the arrhythmia was there.  Of course I took my Amlodipine and have been exhausted all day.  The reason I am trying to get off of this medication is 1:  Terrible heartburn. 2.  This may be the cause of my arrhythmia in the first place.  And did I just have an ablation done to mask it?!?!  And now if I stop am I screwed?  Find something else to take!”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started on Amlodipine 5 mg about 6 weeks ago because my BP had been spiking (as high as 145/110).  Almost immediately my BP went down to more normal levels but after a few weeks I began experiencing anxiety, depression, nervousness and found it difficult to focus on anything.   Sleeplessness became a problem as well.   I've cut the dosage to 2.5 mg on my own but notice that the BP is beginning to rise again.  I don't know what I'm going to do yet but I know I can't bear the way I was feeling before.  Dr. said she's never heard of these side effects for Amlodipine.  So I guess I must be imagining it.”","

First came nausea, which lasted about 2 weeks, however, the chronic insomnia and horrific, extremely vivid nightmares began almost immediately and are still persisting even though I stopped taking it about 6 days ago. Another side effect I experienced was extremely stiff and sore feet - I thought I had developed painful arthritis overnight and walking on them was horrible. I also experienced extreme fatigue all day every day, making it near impossible to care for my three children at home who are all under school age. I thought I was losing my mind.

Blood pressure still wasn't getting close to normal - and I was also getting horrible chest pains, horrible tinnitus - seems like I was holding water.  I finally got him to instead switch the amlodipine to Lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10/12.5 mg dose.  By the second day of taking this my blood pressure totally returned to normal 120/80 - right around there.  I was ecstatic!!! It's been about a week now on the new.”","

I started on Bystolic about four years  ago for my blood pressure. My hair started shedding but just thought it was age. It got to where it was shedding more than normal so I told my doctor.  The doctor changed the prescription  because I was told that  a beta blocker and it caused hair loss. I was put on Amlodipine and stayed on it for a month. I had SEVERE scalp tingling and itching and my hair started falling out in clumps.  I have stopped this medication and my hair is not falling out as bad and the tingling scalp has stopped.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking Amlodipine Besylate 10mg for two years with no issues. My last refill was 3/11/2019 and I noticed the pill was smaller. Then within weeks of taking the new pill I started having arm pain, early morning and early evening. I went back to CVS to ask about changing it out to the prior pills. The Pharmacist took my Rx bottle and went to check the shelf. She then told me it is the same formula and that the provider Lupin Pharmaceuticals changed the appearance of the pill and the new pill is all CVS has. She said to ask my doctor for a different medication if this one no longer works. I know for a fact it is not the Amlodipine Besylate 10mg but a change in the formula when Lupin ""switched the appearance"". Now, I am stuck and angry because they are ALL playing with my health. This is not something that you can just experiment with for new appearances. I am going to call my insurance and complain because I can only go to CVS unless I want to pay full price. So frustrating.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on Amlodipine for five years. My doctor started me on 2.5mg daily, and just last year bumped me up to 5mg. No side effects.

Have suffered with migraines almost 40 years--and have tried lots of meds including Imitrex which was a lifesaver and Botox which helped initially  but not for very long.  As for side effects, no swelling--maybe a little fatigue.  I was on loads of Excredrin and probably 3 Imitrex a week.  So glad to be able to get off these meds.

Like all meds, this will effect everyone differently, but from what the Dr's tell me, it's the one with the least number of side effects. The following are things I have noticed since taking this drug.
1. My legs seem a little weaker than before but have not noticed significant swelling which is one of the main side effects. 
2. At night I have discomfort in my legs generally the thigh muscles. Not pain but discomfort like I ran on a treadmill for an hour. Nothing that keeps me awake.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“11 weeks ago I took just one single tablet of Amlodipine for blood pressure. It brought down BP nicely within 2 hours but the side effects the night after where horrendous, nauseous, felt like all the blood vessels in my head were going to burst. Stopped taking tablets straightaway but still have pain on one single spot on right side of my head after 11 weeks as if a blood vessel is damaged. Very worrying and not nice to be waking up at night with this weird pain in my head. Wish I had never taken that tablet and am waiting for referral to a neurologist to find out what's going on.”",1
Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“This medication changed my life!  At age 60 I thought I would go to my grave with a migraine.  This started at around age 16. Then being diagnosed with high blood preasure I ran the gambet of a few different drugs to figure out what worked best for me.  In the fine tuning stages of treatment I was prescribed Amlodipine in combination with another drug.  Life changing!!!!!  I had migraines at least 3 times a week and suddenly I realised it had been 2 weeks, then 3 then a month, then 2......no headache!  Why oh why did it take all this time to figure it out!  So very Happy with my new life!!!!!!!”","

It ruined my life and even caused my bp spikes at late stage, its an insidious drug and should be banned everywhere! There are better bp meds! Amlo is cheapest and first docs offer...”","

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“Doesn't work to lower blood pressure. I started this medicine 8 months ago and it hasn't done anything. My dr added Benzepril on top of this and my blood pressure is still the same. Switching to a beta blocker next time I go to his office.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Where do I begin!!! I have been taking 5mg for about a year and 1/2 now. My BP readings have been around 135/80 to 140/85. At first I only experienced the flushing, slight headaches, then came the dizziness. A year later, my knees starting hurting, shortness of breath for no reason, my hip started killing me, numbness in my limbs. I tried to stop taking it but my BP shot right up. It's like what do you do?! All BP medicines cause some sort of side effects. My Dr. put me on Atenolol and that seems to be working so far but we'll see.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on amlodipine 5mg for high BP. First time I was on them I only lasted a week. Side effects...itchy skin, dizzy and headaches. This time been on them a month...dizzy, headaches, not sleeping, itchy skin and fatigued”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“From my experience, I found that Amlodipine 5 mg is more effective than Losartan 50 mg. Nearly 10 years I used to take Enalapril 5 mg  twice daily,but BP that time was  ranging from 150/85 to 160/95. Therefore I shifted to Amolodipine 5 mg 2 times about 3 years back and could see a fantastic change in my BP between 110/70 and 120/80.  In between when I could not get Amlodipine for few days I took Losartan 50 morning and 25mg at night and I found my BP 140/85 or 90.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“I've been on norvasc a couple years. It'll does keep my BP down. Biggest issue is fatigue. No energy at all I've been depressed  I thought the fatigue was causing the depression. ?? Doc sent me to get some tests because of the fatigue. Waiting results.”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed this drug three weeks ago by my cardiologist. 5 mg.  I am already on losartan and atenolol as well. Pressure was still a little high around 130/90. Amlodipine does bring the pressure down but not for the whole day. I take it in the morning and in the afternoon my pressure is better but when I take my pressure in the morning it’s still around 130/90.

The biggest positive was migraine prevention. I haven’t had one in three weeks and I don’t think I ever would again if I stayed on this drug but I will not take this drug going forward. The side effects are too severe. 

My feet and ankles swell. I have a bad taste in my mouth. My insomnia is worse. The biggest problem is fatigue. In the afternoon I feel like a zombie. Very hard to get my job done. I find I just sit still and zone out. Not good for productivity.  No drug I have ever taken produced side effects so severe that I have discontinued its use but this one did.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have read most all the comments. I'm so sorry for you people who continue to have problems & are scared from side affects. I am glad to say if I had any side affects I didn't know it. I've taken amlodipine for about 6 years with BP not stable some of the time, around 140/90. I lost about 25lbs & my life changed for the better.  My  BP went down to 116/65 in this area, I take atorvastatin for cholesterol for 10 years, may not even need it now, I'm 64 & have a pace maker for an electrical problem from brain to heart, I also take hydrochlorathiazide which has a diuretic in it. I have nothing bad to say about these meds. I'm hanging in there & I must say, the most help I got was diet & LOSING WEIGHT!!! Help yourself & push away from the table the 1st. time you belch or burp deep when eating, THAT's the time to stop eating, you don't have to feel filled up after a meal, just nutrition & a decent meal, cut them portions!!!”","

I have hypoglycemia and lately I noticed my PULSE was extremely HIGH and my heart raced so fast I was terrified.  I'm pretty healthy and eat OK.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After taking this several weeks I began smelling smoke..It was almost unbearable.  After several more weeks searching for an answer. I discovered other people who had experienced smelling smoke and traced it to a chemical/ mineral (?)  Di-calcium chloride,  or phrosphoric acid or magnesium phosphate. .. there are many names for this compound..  It keeps product from seperating  like; nut butters, orange juice , frappicinos,  over the counter drugs ,liquid vitamins ( sublingual B12 my experience). In Amlodipine the  insert very fine print smelling smoke was listed as  a side effect.   It  took more than 4 weeks after quitting   before the smoke smell left me.  But for this side effect I was pleased with its effectiveness.”","

I had been taking it for about 2 weeks with no noticeable side effects. I thought finally I found the right medicine. Then I started to notice my left knee would really bother me after walking (such as grocery shopping.) Over the next couple of days, my feet, legs and knees were extremely swollen, tight and warm to the touch. I was not in any severe discomfort, but since I knew edema was a possible side effect of this medicine, I showed my doctor. He discontinued the Norvasc.

Amlodipine,For Angina:,"“After a TIA I found I had high blood pressure 170/110. In the hospital they gave me something that caused HUGE adverse reactions. I was then given a brand name sample by my PCP (expensive) that worked but due to price he switched me to the generic equivalent of 2 meds. We adjusted the dosage of each to find the best for me. Settled on Amlodipine 10mg and Quinapril 40mg. Have been taking these for 5+ years with no side effects that I can say are caused by the drugs. (I experience some of the things reported but know some are caused by other issues I have). Nothing is serious. We twice tried to reduce the Quinapril to 20mg but the systolic slowly went up over 2-3 weeks and when it hit 160 I went back to 40mg. Since I started taking these my BP has been about 134/74 regularly. I am now 68 years old 175-180 pounds, exercise, and watch my diet. Works great for me.”","

I went home thinking what the heck and why. By Saturday Morning I was in so much pain I could not walk. The swelling had spread to my knees and the pain to my wrist and finger joints.

I also developed mild hypertension during these years.  My dr. prescribed 2.5mg amlopine and the migraines decreased in intensity.  He upped dosage over time to control the hypertension and my migraine intensity decreased proportionally each time.  By the time I got to 10mg, the migraines were gone.

The doc suspected aortic stenosis (AS).  Now, right then and there the doc should have taken me off Norvasc, because it is contraindicated for AS.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I first developed high BP when pregnant for my son.  I can't remember the medication I was placed on while pregnant, but I was prescribed Amlodipine after pregnancy when my BP refused to return to normal.  That was 9 years ago and until last year it worked great.  I was on 5mg for that time and it was excellent at regulating my BP with zero side-effects.  A year ago my BP started spiking again.  My doc raised me to 10 mg and it helped for a little while, but sadly isn't helping anymore.  I really wish they could just increase the dosage, this medicine didn't make me have any side effects and now I have to start a new one, Losartan.

Are there any natural remedies to treat hypertension- I feel like my life has changed ever since I started taking these pills.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My blood pressure can be pretty high.  My doctor gave me 10mg of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide to counteract swelling in legs.

That really helped, but I still felt a little groggy when I was inactive, so I started taking 5mgs of amlodipine in the morning and then 5mg at night before bedtime.  This helped tremendously.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“It's not the pill for everyone. I took this medication for 2 weeks with other high blood pressure (HBP) control medication and it was long enough to show its side effects for me. The first 3 days I felt pressure in the back of my head and later toward the end of first-week I was experiencing occasional shortness of breath and muscle weakness (not tiredness). You don't want any of these side effects if you do have them, talk to your healthcare provider today. My doc took me off this med nonetheless. As for effectiveness: it wasn't able to bring down my diastolic pressure under 95 most of the time but I did manage 85 couple of times.

I was originally started on Lisinopril for a BP of 130/90 on a consistent basis after lifelong readings of 110/70. Lisinopril gave me bladder spasms no matter when and how I took it and I tried all times and methods for a month. I have had no problems, no discomfort, no side effects from the amlodipine. Since my pressure at the start wasn't that high, my body didn't show any effects of the lowering to a normal pressure as I know will happen if I had allowed my pressures to be consistently markedly elevated.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Taken 5 mg of generic Amlodipine twice a day. Zydus 5mg. imprint 'Z3' a small pill and perhaps the best of the calcium channel blocker, I used it for 2 years, no problems or reactions. Then it was recalled/unavailable. I was switched to Epic brand, some initial side effects, like sweating in not hot weather, tiredness, dizziness. When that was unavailable, pharmacy switched me to pills with the imprint 'IG'/'238' and again initial sweats, but fine for 4 months, then not available.  Was switched to imprint '210' pills, make my bp go higher, when stopped, it went higher still. On (3/3/18) got Cipla, imprint 'C'/'127'.
I hate pharmacies switching brands every month to save 3 cents, or brands that discontinue a pill to merge/buy out another firm, and we lose a good pill when lines merged. No two pills have the same bio-activity, bio-absorption, added fillers, or negative side effects.  Yet doctors & pharmacists consider them all 'equivalent' - Phooey & Double Phooey!!!”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I did a lot of research. Amlodipine seems to be the best migraine preventative for those of us with stubborn nearly daily migraines that don't seem to respond to the typical medications, at least in the long term. I was on two other preventatives for years: Inderal and Amitriptyline. I am now weaning off of both these other medications. I was getting about one headache a week for the first couple weeks at 10 mg, now I think it's been two weeks since my last one. No side effects for me. It's a miracle. Verapamil seems to have the same effect, but requires very high doses up to 720 mg/day.

You MUST try this medication if you have tried the others without lasting effects.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Prescribed for BP but also nearly eliminated migraines. I started having migraines 13 years ago and high BP 1 year ago. My first BP prescription was 5-10mg amlodipine daily. It lowered my BP and *almost* more importantly nearly eliminated all migraines (from previous 2-3 per month to a few for the year of which none were severe enough to require real migraine medications). I believe amlodipine has also expanded and intensified whatever fatigue I might normally experience, but *for me* that is an acceptable tradeoff (yes, fatigue can be limiting, but migraines are limiting and excruciatingly painful). I can see where a person taking amlodipine only for BP might be unhappy with the side effects, but the migraines are far far worse.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was first prescribed a combination pill Amlodipine-Benazepril 10/20mg and after 29 days of taking it I suffered an allergic reaction called Angieodema (Face swelled up)  and it turns out I'm allergic to Benazepril. I went 4 days with no medication and on the 4th day had a dizzy spell at work pressure was 150/118. Dr. called in a new prescription of just Amlodipine 10mg, it's only been 7 days so maybe it's not enough time. However my pressure spiked today to 154/120!!! I feel Great however, I don't have any muscle cramps. I did experience a rapid heart beat a few days ago. My concern is maybe the mg's are too low. Dr is saying to wait 2 weeks to get full effect of the pill. I will update in 2 weeks.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I have had hormonal migraines sine I was 17.  I would have horrible migraines through my menstrual cycle each month.   I developed high blood pressure & my doctor prescribed Linsinopril & when that didn't lower it enough he added Amlodipine.   I took it for about 9 months and never had a migraine which was wonderful.   BUT, I developed waves of severe fatigue and was feeling crappy all over much of the time.  I developed swelling in my feet & ankles & my diastolic blood pressure was almost 100 all the time.  I researched the medicines I've been taking & decided to monitor my blood pressure & stop the Amlodipine.  I instantly felt better & my blood pressure actually went down.  Don't know if migraine will return.  Not worth the side effects!”","

I only need Imitrex now once every two months instead of of two or three times a week.  What a difference in my life!

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I got prescribed Amlopidine for high blood pressure.

However, for years beforehand I had suffered with terrible migraines at a weekly-(ish) frequency. They were crippling, affected my vision, and they would often last for 1-3 days at a time. 

Anyhow, as my BP had been slightly raised consistently, and as my family have a history of hypertension, my current doctor suggested I take Amlopidine.  I had been reluctant to take it as he'd said once on them I should take for the rest of my life.

After 3 months of taking them, however, I realized that I hadn't had a migraine for a while. 6 months further on ... still no migraine.  Amazing!   

I mentioned this to my doctor who then told me that Amlopidine was being used in the treatment of migraines.

Well - it works - What a blessing - it's been liberating!   

I hope it continues to work.”","

After a week I did a BP check at a Pharmacy and my BP was very high so I went home, started the Amlodipine. I started feeling dizzy, had headaches, back pain and weak.  I stopped using it when a friend mentioned Moringa Bitters. I tried it for three days and went for BP check, I found out that my BP was  very high.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started in Amlodopine about a year ago at 10mg my blood pressure dropped down to 115/70 which made me feel ill, 170/100 was my usual. I do have high anxiety and since starting Amlodopine, I’ve put on weight, constantly swelling in my feet, hands and my eyes.  On 5mg, My blood pressure was usually at 130/90 which are good numbers for me where I feel perfect.  I cut back the dosage to 5 mg Because of the severe swelling, but lately my blood pressure is  somewhere about 145/95 and have found I need to take 5 mg twice a day now.  I’m going to try to eliminate Amlodopine and go with the other one hoping there will be less side effects. Amlodopine makes me feel like I have a 90-year-old body with all aches and pains and swelling everywhere. It’s even to the point now where my right foot swells so bad that it makes my foot feel broken and I can’t walk. I was told by the pharmacist that this medication cannot be effective on its own.

Amlodipine,Norvasc (amlodipine) for High Blood Pressure:,"“At first, it's quite effective - and it significantly does work - to lower blood pressure. It has few side effects, and works within 30min - 1.5hrs. The only downside is that it can take 6-8hrs to achieve the full drop, and tolerance develops shortly - about 4 months - after taking it regularly. It's a good step above diuretics, but it's not enough by itself. Combining it with Lisinopril is much better than Norvasc alone.”","

My urine smelled and was coming out frothy. I dropped weight like crazy. I went back to my medical provider after using amlodipine for about two months and my A1C had gone up over 2 points. I was ticked off. The cause was obvious. My provider's obtusely insisted that amlodipine did not cause it. I left the visit and tapered off amlodipine and ramped up my former medication, metroprolol.

A nurse suggested that maybe cutting the dosage in half again might address things, but I'm pretty skeptical.  Currently I'm just on the triamterene-hctz but it's now causing migraines regardless of how hydrated I am, and I'm at a point where I'm going to ""self-diagnose"" and take myself off of it as well, and possibly consult another doctor if need be.

As I've read in other reviews on this site, please make it a point to advocate for yourselves concerning your experiences with the meds being provided to you.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“I suffered from chronic headaches below and above my eyes. It had gotten worse over the years. Never had any specific pattern. Was being affected 3-4 times a week. Intensity was sporadic, nausea, not being able to live life normally. All you do is want to sleep until it goes away. Taking pain pills way too much...

I had high blood pressure that was getting worse as well every year. My doctor put me on amlodipine 5mg daily for this. Headaches were gone. Every now and then I feel them come on but never to the intensity as before. I was recommended so may other drugs to cure my headaches but no one ever mentioned amlodipine. This drug also helped lower my blood pressure (was 150/100 and now 130/90 avg. I was told blood pressure does not cause headaches generally (unless very high). So maybe something else the amlodipine is doing to the blood vessels to alleviate the headaches.”","

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Using 5mg since 8 months. It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.   

Looking forward to hear from those suffering from similar conditions.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“New primary care Doctor said metoprolol wasn’t doing anything for me; made heart rate too low, and prescribed amlodipine 5mg.  
On first day after taking, I had a taste in mouth like metallic shavings, only way I can describe it. Never felt dizzy or lightheaded but heart started beating really fast.  
BP didn’t lower, actually got higher along with heart rate.  Woke up in middle of night with heart thudding each night I was on it. Had to get up and walk around the house trying to calm myself, felt as if I might have a heart attack.  
It caused severe anxiety, aggravation and agitation. And I was on it for only 6 days!   Doctor had me stop taking it and has me monitoring BP etc for now as it works it’s way out of my system.  
Evidently there is some ingredient in the makeup of this drug that my system can’t tolerate. 
At current time, I feel as if I’m having withdrawals from some kind of drugs.

I didn’t realize that it might be caused by amlodipine until two weeks ago. I stopped the drug for about ten days now and feel much better. My panic felling and terrible anxiety are much improved, rectum and anus discomfort is almost gone.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“The doctor prescribed me 10 mg once daily of amlodipine....    my BP when at the office was 155/110 . I go to the doctors only one every one to two years. I'm 31 years old with no health insurance.   I go to an income based pay doctor . I have had swellimg/ tingling in my feet.   No energy during the day because I take amlodipine every morning at 7AM. In the afternoon I feel out of it but on a mission.  Unfortunately my feet feel so funky I just can't get over it.   At first I thought maybe I had strained a tendon or muscle but ....... My feet don't lie.  I'm convinced that amlodipine has caused the weird feeling in my feet and legs.  I will not be taking this medication anymore and I will be contacting my doctor.   Please be aware of the negative effects amlodipine can have in your wellbeing.”,"

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This med works great for keeping my hypertension controlled after failing HCTZ, Lisinopril, Benicar and Spironolactone 5mg. It is the only thing that works consistently. Prefer the oblong tab to the circular as it works better with less side effects and faster so far when it comes to manufacturers. Also fewer migraines and Raynauds too. Rare palpitations I have to remind myself are fine so I don't freak myself out and get more anxiety. If you don't like this med you probably need more vit D, Calcium and magnesium in your life then it should work fine without side effects. Which should help your health anyway in most cases.”","

My body goes through hot and cold flashes and over the past couple days, I've developed lower abdominal pain (sort of like menstrual cramps.....if I remember those).

She took only half a pill the first two days and was okay, but after the whole pill on the third day, she experienced extra breathlessness and a chest congestion.  I went back to half a pill the fourth day, wherein she experienced difficulty swallowing food to the point of choking, something that had NEVER happened before in her life, but of which I had read was an uncommon side effect.  Needless to say, I'm no longer  giving her the drug just to see what new surprises await us on day 5.  Not a fan of this medication to be sure!”","

That was in September 2021 and I have suffered this whole time. Sever anxiety and panic attack. Can't even walk to the bathroom now without my heart feeling like it's gonna bust out of my chest. My legs get so weak I can't walk. Terrible nightmare, night sweats swollen face and neck. The doctor would not listen to me. And it's been 5 months of nightmarish living.  I made an appointment tomorrow with a different doctor because now I can't even walk. I had to go buy a wheelchair just so I can get to the new doctor tomorrow. This is so horrible I been to the ER 5 times because of blood pressure and the chest pains. And they just want to say it's anxiety. It's the freaking side effects of this medication.

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,“I started the medicine and within 3 weeks of increasing to 5 mg I started having really bad irritability.  This is not something I ever ever get. Then after a week the depression set in and it was extremely bad. I was exhausted all the time and I'm usually very very active I lost motivation to do most things. After being on this for 45 days I stopped cold turkey. There was absolutely no way I was going to put any more of this into my body as my mood grew worse and worse. I would rather have high blood pressure than deal with torturous depression. I see many reviews stated that they got anxiety and this was not the case for me it was severe depression. I do want to say that the medication was very effective at lowering my blood pressure. My blood pressure ran 180 over 100 and it has been really hard for me to find an effective medication. This one brought it down to 120 over 85. So it definitely works but the side effects far outweigh the benefits.”,"

Amlodipine,For Migraine Prevention:,"“Writing again, I guess amlodipine has something to do with my sleep stages. I feel some changes in the depth of night sleep. Before taking this med, I was generally having very deep and unconscious type night sleeps and regular migraines in the base of skull (occipital nerves) after awakening in the morning. Whenever I was very tired and feeling very sleepy before going to bed in the night, I woke up in the mid night due to severe pain in the base of the skull. Whenever I suddenly awaken from deep sleep due to external interruption, I found myself a bit confused for some time. With amlodipine, I have moderate depth of sleep and don't get confused if suddenly awaken / interrupted from sleep. No migraines so far.”","

Amlodipine,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Female, 50.  Firstly, I took (10 mg) for high blood pressure, It was prescribed supplementary to my primary BP pill, Losartan, which I stopped years ago due to coughing.  After 1 year of taking Amlodipine, I too began to suffer from feet, ankle and slight calf swelling.  By evening, my feet looked and felt like balloons.  Other side effects ranged from being eyelid heavy tired, no matter how much I slept.  Weird dreams, severe anxiety, feelings of rage/depression, eye pain, strong urine, brain fog, blurry vision, gas, itchy skin.  

I weened myself off of it 3 week ago.  The first thing that I noticed changed overnight was my energy level.  I bounced out of bed the next day.  My feet no longer swell, and my ankles have reduced 97%.  My right calf only slightly starts  to feel tight if I sit too long w/o moving.  I decided to monitor my BP for now, and diet exercise, supplement.  I don't want to go back, but if I do, I'll trial the lowest dose possible 2.5 and stop if same side effects.”","

Unbeknown to her I hadn’t even started taking it yet. After reading all the horror stories of this med I decided not to take it straight away and let the cilazapril run it’s course first to see if it had any effect and if it helped.

Noticed a difference when walking, longer stride and faster pace but had periods of being light headed. My BP went down to 137 on a consistent level. Immediately had trouble sleeping more than 5-6 hours per night. Began to feel that something was in my left chest crawling around plus a few sharp pains. Mild headaches a few days after starting Amlodipine. Thought my body would adjust. Headaches turned into the feeling that the top of my head from the eyebrows up was being squeezed. Intense ringing in my ears to the point I could not watch TV or sleep. Gained back three of the five pounds of water I had been able to remove from my legs and feet and my BP climbed to 145 which I figured was due to the water in my legs. If amlodipine was putting water back it, amlodipine was defeating the purpose of lowering my BP. Took myself off of amlodipine and notified doctor.”","

During a very stressful part of my life (5 years ago), while slightly jogging, I began to feel weird stabbing chest pain and a strange sensation in my mouth.  I notified my doctor about it and she prescribed Amlodipine.  I used to get migraines, but now, I don’t anymore. The stabbing pain stopped, too. After two years and loss of 20 pounds, I asked to have my Amlodipine lowered from 5mg to 2.5mg. I still feel good. Hopefully, I will lose more weight and reduce Amlodipine even more.

Distance yourself from the world of drama and bad news, talk to wife or spouse have more sex, find natural ways of relaxing , the anxiety will leave over time, current doctors are not always on your side, if you are on no pill and still having issues it's your lifestyle, sell the house downsize, come up with a plan to minimize and reduce stress.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I started taking Losartan HCZT 50/12.5 around two years ago.  Never had anxiety issues before but after a year or so on the medication I started felling very nervous.  So bad I had to take Zoloft for around 3 months.  I did a little research and found that Losartan can make you hypoglycemic.  The symptoms of low blood sugar are nervousness and shaky.  I started drinking a sugar drink like soda when I felt that way and 20-30 minutes I would  feel better.  This all started because I started to diet to naturally lower my BP and probably made myself hypoglycemic.  Please try it and let me know if it helps.  It is scary when you get that nervousness feeling.  The Doctors and pharmacist have no clue about the side affects.  They blame it on you.....”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am so thankful for those that have posted on this site about the side effects of losartan, namely, anxiety.  My doctor had prescribed this drug for high blood pressure Over weeks and then months I started having feelings of nervousness.  At first I thought it was due to life events.  It got so bad that I am sure I had panic attacks.  I then found this site, with anxiety being listed as a side effect.  I went to see a psychiatrist, and said the feelings I was experiencing were anxiety.  I went back to my original doctor and told him about it.  He said he had never had a patient taking Losartan with anxiety as a side effect, but agreed that I go completely off any medication.  Once I did that, I started feeling better within 3 days.  After a month, I was almost back to feeling normal!  This is a very serious side effect on this medication, and again, I thank those that have posted of your experiences.   I hope to do the same for others with this post.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am a Physician Assistant with years long hypertension. I have been on various combinations of medications to manage my blood pressure. My current combination includes Losartan 50 mg twice/day. It’s effectiveness has been good but my blood pressure is affected by my work, sleep, my weight (normal) and exercise. 
But after six months on Losartan, I have not had anxiety that I connect to Losartan. But if you believe that anxiety began after starting Losartan, then ABSOLUTELY discuss it with your physician. To anyone who is started on Losartan AFTER a heart attack and has symptoms of anxiety, please keep in mind that anxiety or depression are not uncommon after a heart attack.  These feelings are real and should also be discussed with your physician. Our minds are processing lots of information 24 hours/day.  Sorting out the source of anxiety can be challenging and your medical team can help you.. There is no such thing as “one size ( or dose) fits all”.”","

I couldn't help but wonder if I got the wrong medicine.  I found that I was given the generic brand from Camber (egged shaped white pill) and I reviewed the brand history that I have gotten in the past, and this is the 1st time I have received it.  I discussed with my doctor, and she provided a prescription for the the brand Aurobindo (egg shaped light green pill) that I had received in the past, but it was denied by insurance.  I paid out of pocket to get it, and blood pressure went back to normal, and headaches stopped.  I spoke with my pharmacist about my issues with the Camber brand, and he said that he has gotten several recent complaints about it.

However I have found that I have anxiety and insomnia due to this medication. I am talking to my doctor today to stop this medication.  I believe it works for my blood pressure lowering, however it's hard to tell as I'm on another medication as well and I need to titrate myself to find out if this medication is effective.

Other BP drugs I tried before Losartan:

Amlodipine - CCB made me feel like my heart was racing and worsened CFS/ME. Headaches went with drop in BP. Constant urination waking me up in the night.

Beta Blockers ruled out due to CFS/ME.

Ramipril - ACE Inhibitor worked for a month or so then started having really bad palpitations, they pulled me off the ramipril after an ECG. Had an odd metallic taste in mouth.

Losartan - ARB I Don't feel ANY side-effects whatsoever, bar the positive one of no more constant headaches/migraines, BP is a stable 120/83 average on 50mg taken once daily. Just plain lowering my blood pressure, I don't even think about it when I take it every morning. Reviews show kidney function so far is fine.

Distance yourself from the world of drama and bad news, talk to wife or spouse have more sex, find natural ways of relaxing , the anxiety will leave over time, current doctors are not always on your side, if you are on no pill and still having issues it's your lifestyle, sell the house downsize, come up with a plan to minimize and reduce stress. Life is short, do it today”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on 50 mg of Losartan for one week today and I feel as if I have gained 50 pounds. I have not actually gained any weight, but I feel as if I am carrying around 50 lbs of sandbags. I'm normally very active and upbeat, but now everything seems like such an effort. I feel all day as if I'd really rather just go back to bed. Others feel this way? A profound heaviness, sluggishness. BP is down about 10%.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I started taking Losartan HCZT 50/12.5 around two years ago.  Never had anxiety issues before but after a year or so on the medication I started felling very nervous.  So bad I had to take Zoloft for around 3 months.  I did a little research and found that Losartan can make you hypoglycemic.  The symptoms of low blood sugar are nervousness and shaky.  I started drinking a sugar drink like soda when I felt that way and 20-30 minutes I would  feel better.  This all started because I started to diet to naturally lower my BP and probably made myself hypoglycemic.  Please try it and let me know if it helps.  It is scary when you get that nervousness feeling.  The Doctors and pharmacist have no clue about the side affects.  They blame it on you.....”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am so thankful for those that have posted on this site about the side effects of losartan, namely, anxiety.  My doctor had prescribed this drug for high blood pressure Over weeks and then months I started having feelings of nervousness.  At first I thought it was due to life events.  It got so bad that I am sure I had panic attacks.  I then found this site, with anxiety being listed as a side effect.  I went to see a psychiatrist, and said the feelings I was experiencing were anxiety.  I went back to my original doctor and told him about it.  He said he had never had a patient taking Losartan with anxiety as a side effect, but agreed that I go completely off any medication.  Once I did that, I started feeling better within 3 days.  After a month, I was almost back to feeling normal!  This is a very serious side effect on this medication, and again, I thank those that have posted of your experiences.   I hope to do the same for others with this post.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am a Physician Assistant with years long hypertension. I have been on various combinations of medications to manage my blood pressure. My current combination includes Losartan 50 mg twice/day. It’s effectiveness has been good but my blood pressure is affected by my work, sleep, my weight (normal) and exercise. 
But after six months on Losartan, I have not had anxiety that I connect to Losartan. But if you believe that anxiety began after starting Losartan, then ABSOLUTELY discuss it with your physician. To anyone who is started on Losartan AFTER a heart attack and has symptoms of anxiety, please keep in mind that anxiety or depression are not uncommon after a heart attack.  These feelings are real and should also be discussed with your physician. Our minds are processing lots of information 24 hours/day.  Sorting out the source of anxiety can be challenging and your medical team can help you.. There is no such thing as “one size ( or dose) fits all”.”","

I couldn't help but wonder if I got the wrong medicine.  I found that I was given the generic brand from Camber (egged shaped white pill) and I reviewed the brand history that I have gotten in the past, and this is the 1st time I have received it.  I discussed with my doctor, and she provided a prescription for the the brand Aurobindo (egg shaped light green pill) that I had received in the past, but it was denied by insurance.  I paid out of pocket to get it, and blood pressure went back to normal, and headaches stopped.  I spoke with my pharmacist about my issues with the Camber brand, and he said that he has gotten several recent complaints about it.  My takeaway, not all generics are created equal, and this a problem.”",1

""oh I'm going to die kind of feelings"".  I realised what the issue was and moved the medication schedule to late at night so that I would have feelings whilst I was sleeping. However I have found that I have anxiety and insomnia due to this medication. I am talking to my doctor today to stop this medication.  I believe it works for my blood pressure lowering, however it's hard to tell as I'm on another medication as well and I need to titrate myself to find out if this medication is effective.  If you have symptoms of strong anxiety 3-4 hours after taking this medication this may be the cause.  It is very unnerving and puts you into a very strange state of paranoia.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Have tried nearly all the frontline drugs for hypertension, which averaged 155/110. Constant headaches and I am 26 years old. I have always had issues with many pharmaceuticals, but not this one.

Other BP drugs I tried before Losartan:

Amlodipine - CCB made me feel like my heart was racing and worsened CFS/ME. Headaches went with drop in BP. Constant urination waking me up in the night.

Beta Blockers ruled out due to CFS/ME.

Ramipril - ACE Inhibitor worked for a month or so then started having really bad palpitations, they pulled me off the ramipril after an ECG. Had an odd metallic taste in mouth.

Losartan - ARB I Don't feel ANY side-effects whatsoever, bar the positive one of no more constant headaches/migraines, BP is a stable 120/83 average on 50mg taken once daily. Just plain lowering my blood pressure, I don't even think about it when I take it every morning. Reviews show kidney function so far is fine.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I had been on losartan 50 mg/day in AM (mfg. unknown) for over 7 years. with bp of around 125-135\68-72. A few months back my pharmacy started dispensing the Camber brand of Losartan and my bp  went up to roughly 
145/75, so my doctor eight days ago increased the dose to 100 mg daily in AM. My BP has risen since changing the dose and is now averaging in the mid-150s/mid-70s.
I realize that it takes 2-4 weeks to reach a stabilization point but I had expected the bp to start receding rather than increasing.
 My concerns are: did the change of manufacturer precipitate the increase in bp and also weight gain, lethargy and mild panic attacks?
  I’m going to check with my pharmacy to see if other losartan patients using the Camber brand share the same concerns after the change in manufacturer and also check with my primary doctor to see what alternative meds are available.

My BP did not shoot up but stayed at about 120/80 and I monitored it closely, maintaining a careful diet and exercise. I stopped taking the drug completely and my blood pressure has stayed low in the 120-130/80-90. I plan to see my doctor for a physical next month and I am sure she will be aghast that I stopped Lozartan on my own. Any advice on how to break the news to her?”",1
Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Took it almost a year and it did lower my bp. I noticed depression, bad headaches, severe stomach pains after taking it within a half hour, horrible dizziness etc. I made my own choice to stop taking it. I was on 100 mg a day. Four days off of it headaches are gone, dizziness went away and the brain fog cleared up. Imagine that!!! Although it did give me some anxiety coming off it but seems to be going away. Please people stop taking this drug if you have side effects. I’m still on nifidipine and propranolol. The doctor wanted to give me Zoloft for my depression can you see the pattern here. I can only imagine how many drugs he would pump me with after a year. If you don’t believe me stop taking it for a few days yourself and see how much better you feel. Good luck everyone”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I took Losartin 50 mg for months and it helped with my BP and kept it really low, like 105/70, except it caused severe back pain. But then they had a recall, and I am on a different brand and since then I have developed many side effects, including chronic left shoulder pain, anxiety and tachycardia. It is causing my blood pressure to shoot up high at times. The doctor increased the dose to 100 mg and the back pain returned. I told my doctor about the anxiety and pain but she said these are not side effect symptoms. She added  Lopressor for the BP and tachycardia, because I requested it,  and I am weaning myself off the Losartin, myself now due to terrible side effects. You can not take Motrin or similar meds. While on Losartin so can not even treat the back and shoulder pain. I did insist on a EKG due to the new tachycardia and I am scheduled to see a cardiologist who I hope will be much better educated on these medications.”","

I did not associate it with the change to the generic until a year later when certain other reasons I switched back to the brand name. Almost immediately my heartburn problem subsided. Please be aware of this if you are using a generic instead of Cozaar and you develop heartburn.”","

So one doctor made me sick, 4 doctors  failed to find the answer, but luck intervened on my behalf. Leg/back pain occurs in up to 10% of users, but 4 doctors never suggested this as a cause.

Within hours of switching back to HCTZ, now my blood pressure is normal again. Losartan might work for some, but it didn't work for me.

I'm on week 5 and I've suddenly got a blocked nose and ears.  And anxiety started yesterday morning has been coming in rolling waves of panic attacks now over 24-48 hours making me feel like I would rather die than experience that. (Have had a few attacks over 15 years, and mild depression but nothing like this). Started wondering if it was a side effect of the Losartan.  Found a number of people on here have had very similar experiences, so presumably these are side effects, but I won't know until I stop taking it.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been put on Losartan as part of a post-op medication after having stents placed in my coronary arteries.

Losartan definitely lowers my blood pressure but there is no doubt that it causes anxiety and a feeling of fear.  It seems to amplify an emotional response to any negative thoughts and gets you to fear those questions.

I have found that changing my schedule for taking the medication also changes the schedule of the anxiety.  Ie it follows the taking of the drug by about 3 hours (which is when the drug peaks apparently).

There is no doubt that anxiety and feelings of negative well being are side effects.  So if you're having an emotional reaction (in my case 3 hours after taking) this medication may be the cause.

I am taking just before bed to hopefully mask the feelings as I'll be asleep. TBD if it affects sleep.”","

They both say it’s highly questionable to make a 71-year old at 145/82 take ANY bp med. Their advice would be :
You can live your life to the fullest if you  don’t take ANY bp meds. If you trust your cardiologist, then you should do what he/she says. But if you kinda 50 - 50 on him/her then I’d re-think taking any drugs at all,”","

This time I was in quite a bit of pain & after day one & figuring out the drug was likely the issue (again), I went off it.  The next day was a bit better & today my throat is fine.  Just because you don't see a side effect listed does NOT mean a drug doesn't cause that effect in you.  The only way to know for sure is to go off it and see if the effect goes away.  Not recommending people stop cold turkey but my blood pressure is borderline, so I just quit taking the pills.

Although I have a stress free life, I have constant heaviness in my chest making it difficult to breathe, chronic insomnia, and massive bruises that form on my leg, (without any incident of bumping them against anything). I am tired throughout the day, since I am not sleeping, and feel terrible. I have spikes in my blood pressure and am concerned because my doctor dismisses these issues.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My blood pressure was improved with Lorsartan, but I had many side effects.  My blood pressure would drop to as low as 98 over 84 with heart rate of 130. I would be dizzy and so tired I just wanted to sleep. At least  once a week I would experience diarrhea. I coughed a lot and it was getting worse.  I had foot and leg cramps.  I was feeling terrible.  Since stopping use of this drug and improving my diet I am feeling much better and my symptoms have disappeared. My blood pressure is under control without it.  This drug is poison and was killing me.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“The doctor put me on 50mg losartan a month ago, as new insurance wouldn't pay for the Candesartan I was on. It works great keeping blood pressure at good levels along with the Metoprolol I'm on also. For the first 3 weeks I started off having mild headaches that finally disappeared, and now I have a slight sore throat all of the time, a slight hacking cough, and only one nostril that runs constantly....weird, I know. I'm going to give it another month and see if these side effects disappear like the headaches.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have been on losartan since mid 2016. My Cardiologist lets me tailor the dosage to my needs. I usually take between 25-50 mg daily in the morning. Around the end of 2019 refilled RX. Noticed that the pills are white now instead of the blue or green.  I now have to take 50-100 mg to get any BP reduction. And now can't sleep at night. Was a side effect before when on higher doses. So Asked the Pharmacist whats the story . They haven't heard of anything. Told the new GP and she didn't know anything about it. Any ideas?”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My husband was put on Losartan 50 mg Sept. 12, on Sept 14 he started experiencing brain fog and ache in his right shoulder, sleepless night.  The symptoms progressed.  Unsteady on his feet, uselessness of right arm, tremors, called Dr she cut him back to 25 mg on 9/23,. Still symptoms progressed to so much brain fog he doesn't know how to use remote control, can't find things that are right in front of him, gave up driving, gave up cooking, I have to cut up his food.  We went to ER this past Saturday to rule out stroke.  They said it is his medication.  Back to Dr.  She took him off Losartan after begging her.  Upped his water pill and kept him on his Amlodipine to see how he does.  He was up all night last night, missing another day of work today.  I am sure I have missed something that this medicine has caused him, I pray they are not long term effects.  I don't understand why if it is also recalled why the FDA has not pulled it.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was diagnosed last year with  high blood pressure (HBP) at the age of 67, no other meds. Within months of starting Losartan I noticed changes in my hair texture, thinning  & loss.  It’s just thin, lifeless, shedding, whispery hair mainly at the crown at the back of my head. I know it is because of this drug.  Have not discussed this matter yet with my doctor. We are looking for some quick fixes here are my suggestions check out on-line:    DHT Blocker, hair loss; check out Olive Leaf Extract for lowering BP and blood sugar.  For help with your current thin and lifeless hair I suggest:   CHI Shampoo Magnified Volume and a good hair mousse like TRESemme Thermal Creations for volume boosting, NOT their 24 hr Body mousse, or Catwalk Strong Mousse.  This will allow you to at least look like you have more hair and feel better about yourself in the interim. These are simply my suggestions to temporarily deal with this hair loss until we can all pitch this med in the garbage.”","

The losartan from this lab only one that showed side effects. Pharmacy is marking my file so I don't get that brand again. Some of the previous patients might want to consider the manufacturer/lab & change that. Another thing is they are extremely bitter. Taste it as soon as I put it in my mouth. Previous ones were not like that,”","

Now she is recuperating and when we give her losartan it seems to knock her blood pressure really low and makes her weak for 2 hrs.  She has had a hacking cough and recurrent bronchitis for years. I did not know that could be a side effect of the losartan. These are the only meds she takes except for a daily multi-vitamin.”,"

I have been exercising every morning at 5am and have been eating very good during this time. Yet it appears I've gained weight and my legs feel like jello and if I squat down its hard for me to get up. I first thought it was because I haven't been running in forever but its been 3 weeks of running and its getting worse. Ankles, behind the knees and calf muscles are the worst.

I believe this medication will do much more harm than good, so please be careful...I took it because Lisinopril gave me a cough.  I gave it 3-full months and during that time, I became very ill.  Extreme fatigue, headaches, sore back, weakness in my legs that was very scary.  I felt like I had the flu daily and I thought it might be another medication I was on, but I tested myself by stopping the other med's and nope...the symptoms still remained.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was put on Losartan for my high blood pressure after the Beta blocker Metoprolol didn't seem to do the trick.  Over the course of the year I was taking Losartan, it was gradually increased because it wasn't effective at the higher dose for very long.  During this time, I began experiencing tight throat and tongue, extreme anxiety.  Once I was again moved higher, to the max dosage of 100 milligrams,  the swelling in my tongue and throat became so bad I was taken to the ER three times.  My doctor at the time never suggested withdrawing from Losartan.  I finally went to a second doctor who took me off the Losartan cold turkey and put me on chlorthalidone instead.  Five days since the immediate stop of Losartan, and the feeling of swelling in the throat and tongue as well as feeling like all of my muscles are constricted have been 10 fold.  I'm tired of going to ER.  This medicine poisons you.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Several (3+/-) yrs ago I was on this med losartan and don't remember having any side effects.  Eventually my BP went down too low and my doc took me off all my BP meds (was on 3 different BP meds at one point!).  I didn't take anything for a few years after.  Now for some reason my BP is high again (average about 150/100) so my new doc put me on 50mg of losartan. This is my first day taking it again.  Hopefully no side effects but it would be hard to tell since I have Lupus, have had spinal fusion recently (this past Dec), and have a hiatal hernia which causes severe stomach pain often so I am in constant pain on a daily basis. I was on lisinipril for years and had developed a horrible chronic dry cough. Nobody could explain what was causing the cough.  Finally I ended up seeing a new doc who said immediately that it was because of the lisinipril and changed it to the losartan.  My cough went away and didn't happen while on losartan.  Well I will update after I am on this med for a while.”","

Many of the 1 star reviews point to the same digestive/stomach issues I'm having beginning on the day I started Losartan.

I have found that taking a Magnesium Glycinate supplement has helped a bit with the anxiety (a little bit) however the drugs effectiveness has seemed to diminish (ie BP isn't lowered anymore).

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“My Dr had put me on the Losartan. Right after I started taking it, my whole back was in so much pain. I had told my Dr about the pain and I believed it was the Losartan. He said I had a physically demanding job. Keep taking it. After being in so much pain, I couldn't work I emailed him and explained my pain. He said there has been no case studies of it causing back pain to keep taking it. After telling him three times I was in pain due to this medicine and he still would not help me I am switching Drs. Yes, it lowered my blood pressure but the back pain I was having is NOT worth it!”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“Taking Losartan 50mg for approximately 2.5 years.  Within the last 8-months started getting abdominal pains which after a run would work its way down into my groin area and then either my left or right hip joint.  The pain became overwhelming where I have recently stopped running.  After cutting out all my medication for 4-days I am pain free.  I did do a CAT Scan on my abdomen and hip with no findings.  I did not put together that after 2.5 years I would start having a reaction to the medication.   Getting ready to start running again and look into a new BP  medication.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on Losartan 100mg for about 4 months now.  At first, it seemed fine with no apparent problems. Blood pressure was still pretty high until medication was added making it my 4th. I have been getting progressively worse with tiredness, joint and body pain.  Referred to physical therapy with no improvement.  Just hurts to move.  I have experienced this before and quickly improved after medication changes.  Thinking it may be the Losartan because I was on it before but don't remember why I was taken off.”",1

Doctor sent me to a neurology doctor who found no nerve problems, gave me pain pills.  I read up on Losartan and noted it caused leg cramps.   I took myself off and had no problems with cramps.  Six months later I lost all muscle use in my body, lost 30 lbs instantly.  Now do know what to do, it has now been a year and I just lost a kidney.  This is a very very bad drug”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have been very healthy my entire life thank God until last year that my blood pressure starting going up. Doctor prescribed Metoprolol and Lisinopril. Started coughing constantly that ended up at the ER thinking I had pneumonia. ER Dr switched Lisinopril for Losartan Potassium. Leg and back pain is unbearable to the point that I cannot almost stand and even walk. I am afraid of falling. Dizzy and tired. No need to have this quality of life. Dangerous side effects even worse than what I felt when BP started going up. It has to be something better than this.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Losartan 50mgs 3 years ago. Pain in left eye felt too big for socket; pins needles numbness left arm; insomnia; leg cramps, calf fasiculations. Pulsatile tinnitus. Opthalmologist said I have naevi in eye, prob birthmark but 3 yrs prior & 6 years prior to that no naevi. Heart felt like it might just stop?  I had anxiety agreed with GP to come off meds in May 2018 (supervised). Bloods normal, low carb diet, lost 3 stone and BP and blood sugar normal range. The tinnitus and calf fasc remain.
Jump forward to 26th Mar 19 and my BP climbing so GP started Losartan 50mgs but took 25mgs with in 4 weeks tinnitus +++ Calf fasiculations +++.
April rushed to ER  with a pulse of 213 for 45 mins. ECG confirmed SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) MRI-no structural issues with my heart. No prior cardiac issues. Cardiologist -next step is catheter ablation but what about Losartan being the cause? If calf fasiculations are misfiring electrical signals in muscles why not heart muscle too?
So we stop it wait and see!”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Prescribed Losartan, partly because I'm dealing with a gout flare, and it supposedly helps with that as well. It's like my doctor didn't even take my disability (which is a 36 year old C4-5 spinal injury causing partial paralysis, and makes up about 80% of my med records) into account: chronic bad back, chronic edema, spasticity/muscle cramping, tinnitus, life-long history of migraines, chronic sinus infections, insomnia, bowel & bladder incontinence, chronic fatigue. I wish I'd have researched this med before taking it, because its side effects are EXACTLY contrary to nearly ALL of the things that I suffer as a result of my disability. Spent the entire night awake, ears ringing like mad, fever dreaming, head banging on one side, hands going numb, terribly anxious, and feeling like at any minute I was going to explode.

Losartan,Cozaar (losartan) for High Blood Pressure:,"“I was actually prescribed Benicar 3 months ago for my newly diagnosed HBP, but my insurance company contacted my doctor and informed them Benicar wasn't covered under my plan, so they switched me to Losartan. I have to break the pill in half, and I feel like my dosage is compromised doing so. The first thing I noticed was headaches, nausea and brain fog. When I mentioned this to both my GP and a specialist I go to, they both said to wait a couple more weeks until I have been on it a while. Now I have joint pain, tingling in legs and feet, and I notice my feet swell in my shoes. The swelling isn't noticeable, but I can feel it in my shoes. I plan to see my GP this coming week. I am frustrated I want to start an exercise program. I am not terribly overweight, but I don't know how much exercise I can do with all this joint pain (especially knees).  What are my options for a medication change, and will all the meds in this class give me the same side effects?”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started to swell up, then I was not able to urinate for many hours at a time.  The fluids kept building up in my legs and in my torso, and hands/arms.  Finally, I and my wife said enough when I could not swallow and my face swelled up.  Allergy medications helped me breath and reduced the swelling in my throat and face.  I am now into my first month of still having fluids in my lungs and legs.  Doctors are now trying to reduce the excess fluids with more blood pressure meds and lasix.  Now just pockets of fluids in my lungs but the shortness of breath is still lingering.  I would not recommend this medication for anyone who needs a diuretic as blood pressure medication, please do not allow your doctor to prescribe this for you.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I’ve been on Losartin 100 mg over a year.  I have gained weight and look bloated. I thought I was drinking too much beer and stopped all alcohol. Nothing changed. The biggest side effect was the inflammation of my left parotid gland with pain.  My throat also swelled. My doctor sent me to a ENT doctor and I had an MRI.  That was clear.  No one knew what caused it until I finally found this a side effect of Losartin by googling.  Not every article showed this as a side effect. I am currently switching, but seem to have problems with a dry cough when I take other BP meds. My issue is that it so hard to lose weight so you can go off any BP medication. Endless cycle.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking losartan for some years now. ln 2018, I was taking it as always and notice that for a bit the pills had a much more bitter taste than normal. I remember telling my husband that suppose the pharmacy gave me some expired medicine but the it wasn't. Well I continued to take it and notice that my blood pressure was staying high and that was not good because I was taking it to protect my transplanted kidney from being damaged from hypertension. Continued to take it and sometime last year I end up with cancer in my small intestine out of the blue. I had a CT scan earlier in the year of my abdomen area with contrast and there was no tumor there. Well when they did a colonoscopy, the doctor thought where it was was really unusual. he sent biopsies to pathology and it came back as a cancer. I was taken of losartan and put on Micardis a older med that similar to the losartan. I went thru a colectomy and chemo so yes I am definitely looking into this issue. God bless you all.”",1

It didn't lower my blood pressure much more than the spiro did by itself.  My blood pressure still sat at about 145/95.  After about 3 days of taking it, I started feeling a nauseous. By the 5th day, I couldn't eat because I felt so ill.  I didn't eat for nearly 4 days straight.  I stopped taking the medication because I couldn't handle the sickness, and within the next day, the nausea went away.  It caused me to have a very hard time sleeping, and I was forgetting things constantly.  I couldn't remember simple things I did in my daily routine and would forget where I was sometimes.”","

Now my readings are almost never over 120/65 and my resting heartbeat averages 60 bpm.  I haven't noticed any side effects, no dry cough, no anxiety issues.  I agree with other commenters,  no drug is without issues for many patients, but this fits my needs and I am very satisfied with the results.

I went to Urgent Care for some medical attention and told of all the side effects I was having which were as follows; heart rate was increased from approximately 78 beats per minute - 114 beats per minute.

Will be changing doctors. So now, I have to seek medical attention for my kidneys, which were never an issue, because no one bothered to do an allergy test on me for this medication. It was the worst 48 hours of my life. I know this medication works for other people, but please get tested before you take it, it only took one dose of 50mg's to give me this reaction.”","

Felt horrible, had to take time off work, finally went back to urgent care and got them to switch me back to the triampterene.

That physician prescribed 100Mg Losartan and 25 mg Metoprolol.  A month later I had a heart attack.  I now monitor my pressure twice daily at random times.  Average (145/80)  Four months ago, I became vegan.  No meat, fish, dairy, eggs or oil.  BP started plummeting about 2 weeks into it.  About a month ago started noticing BP much lower than usual, (120/71) this is a good thing, but feeling faint after eating (90/66) is not.

Now two weeks in I have developed pretty bad stomach pain, BAD constipation and leg cramps.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Losartan gave me painful backaches and pretty severe swelling in my hands and feet.  Because of this, I had to take a potassium supplement for the backache and then hztc for the fluid retention.  I do not like having to take two medications to control the side effect of one medication.  Those issues got under control, but now it has given me chronic diarrhea so I have to switch.  All that aside, Losartan does control my blood pressure very well, and I've had issues with Norvasc, Lisinopril, Bystolic, and Clonadine.  Maybe I'm sensitive.  If you have hard to control blood pressure, this might be a powerful drug that will work for you.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I ran out of losartan and could not get a refill for about 10 days. Using my personal BP cuff my blood pressure ran up to almost 200/120. Scary. I got my refill and after taking 1 pill a day for 3 days my blood pressure is back to 135-140/85-90. I am quite happy that it worked relatively quickly and I'm back in the normal range. I am 71.”,"

Have SLE lupus, Raynaud's, Gerds, Migraines, Osteo, Edema, prone to Ulcers, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, suffer frequent joint pain. Severe side effects from Losartan sent me to ER by day 3. Legs weak and wobbly to point of nearly falling, extreme severe knotted cramps in feet lasting over half hour that spread with sharp stinging pain over entire body, severe pressure around head, minor trembling, severe joint pain, total exhaustion. Also dry eyes and mouth, constant peeing. Bad drug! Dangerous!”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Itching, runny nose, but worse of all, weight gain, I might add I exercise 3-4 times per week, Low Impact High Intensity, I am a Pescatarian, I eat a healthy, well balanced meal and don't eat dairy and few carbs, how can one medicine cause nearly 21 lbs in weight gain so quickly, every effort to lose weight, nothing worked, I even did the 5:2 diet for three months and lost, not one inch!!!! Unbelievable! So I changed to Ramipril, apparently all ARB's cause weight gain, except 'Micardis' which can actually reduce weight, but! has been found to increase the risk of Lung cancer (Moderately) which is quite concerning, such a shame as I would have swapped onto that.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Started about a year ago,then started having severe chest and back pain ,with shortness of breath, and loss of my voice. Went to ER ,first time they said chronic bronchitis, breathing treatments only made it worse. Next time in ER they said it was asthma attack. Finally got to cardiologist who again said it was not my medication causing it. After going though heart cath I started skipping my losartan once a day then did not take it for couple days. Took it today due you increase in bp, now having same back and chest pain and shortness of breath.  Stopping it for week then try again if this comes back will talk to pcp about changing it or not taking bp med at all ..   My bp has been great with out losartan. 125/74”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am on 37.5 mg Losartan after switching from amlodipine. It has probably caused symptoms like I can't take a deep breath, having a cough.  I need to urinate often and it relaxes your blood vessels, so that makes sense.  Exercise is the best thing to keep my BP down and I'm trying to lose weight so I can get off BP medications completely.   I walk on the treadmill or stairmaster at lunch and my BP is lower on days I exercise. I encourage everyone to really try to lose just 10 pounds - if you lose even 10 pounds you can probably lower your dose of the medication (under your doctor's advice) and the smaller dosage you need to take, the fewer side effects you will have!  Just try it - I wish you luck!”","

I had sore muscles in legs and was unable to move as quickly as I normally had been. After taking 50 mg once daily my blood pressure elevated higher than before starting. Dr increased my dosage to 100 mg daily in the form of 50 mg twice daily. Then my symptoms went from bad to worse, uncontrollable itching on almost my whole body. I had diminished kidney function. I have a thick wall on my bladder which needs biopsy. Red blood cells present in urine. I have frequent  nausea and weight dropped from 205lb to 155lb. I have just stopped cold turkey over 3 weeks ago the itching stopped but some other symptoms remain. Don't know what long term effects this has caused but I do know my health has deteriorated.”","

Did no research so I wouldn't predispose myself to side effects. From day 1 they were intense 6-8 hours after taking the pill.  Leaving work on day 1 I was convinced I was having a stroke or a heart attack.  ER cleared me.  Lightheaded, dizzy, skin numbness and tingling, palpitations, fatigue and overall bundle of nerves.  Cut the pill in half, did little to reduce the side effects.  Within a week I quit taking it.  Blood pressure on it 103/71.  Blood pressure off it 118/79.  I was a Tourrette's kid in the 80s so I did the circuit of meds....haldol, clonidine, orap, you name it.  Dystonia, low BP, rapid weight gain. I know I am sensitive to medications.  Hopefully this post helps someone.”","

Since changing to Losartan 100mg, which was a little over a year ago, my BP stays around 130/62. As I said before, I do have other issues so I can not attribute any other problems with it.

Now16 months later I am still recovering from the terrible side effects this drug caused for me. My Dr was very skeptical that the losartan was the cause. I was lost in the medical care system and ended up having a 2 level fusion in my neck to try to relieve the pain in my arms. Didn’t work. Every day is a challenge and am still searching for a Dr that can help and believe in my symptoms. Now I take a beta blocker without any side effects.”,"

BP was 180/100. Went to doctor who put me back on Losartan Potassium 50 mg. It's been a couple weeks now and my BP is down to 120/80 range, which is good. However, side effects are so debilitating. Wheezing, dry cough, headache, mood swings, irregular heartbeat (scary), heartburn, and worst effect is the inability to concentrate. I'm in a total fog, but thinking clearly enough to remember this was some of the same stuff I dealt with over the years I was taking it before, though less intense back then. Maybe my sensitivity has increased since being off it for a while and coming back to it. Nasty stuff. I can't go on taking it and have contacted my doctor.”","

Then I noticed constipation and my bp spiking back up. Ringing in my ears. Week 3- depression and irrational emotions. I was not myself at all.  I had a total body ache, fever of 100.8 which sent me home from work. When I went to an urgent care center the on the 2nd day of fever, sweating and chills and painful lymph nodes, my bp was just as high as the day I started the drug.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“Just started on it a week ago after having no effect from diltiazem and a load of side effects. I don't feel like the dosage is high enough at 50 mg a day as my blood pressure spikes early morning at 145/100 upon waking and drops during the day after the medicines get in my system. I think I also may have sleep apnea that contributes to my high morning blood pressures. Finding a patient doctor has been very difficult as I have side effects from just about any medicine I take.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking Losartin for sudden high blood pressure a few months ago. I've noticed that my skin is having breakouts on my shoulders and chest, which is not normal for me at all. I've had this reaction on birth control before, so after thinking about it, the timing of this symptom with my starting this drug match up. I've also lately been having a terrible time sleeping, feeling unusually exhausted during the day and evening, and been having a cough with hacking up phlegm that won't go away. Also had unusual muscle pains. I don't know for sure if any of these things are related to this drug, but after reading the comments here, I see most are happening to other people too. I think I'm going to stop taking this and see what happens.”",1

I took Losartan for blood pressure but I’m always taking a pain medicine that causes no side effects. I’m 31 years old and I’ve never had a bad drug reaction. When I took this, I was at work and my co workers noticed my eyes fluttering and unusual behavior. Long story short, it turned out to be a two day thing and very embarrassing for me. My GM has to call an Uber for me and wouldn’t allow me to drive home. I took no medicine the second day and it was still causing these sedating effects. Never again!”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been taking Losartan for eight weeks now. Just 25mg per day. I am very fit, healthy, normal BMI and exercise a lot. Non smoker. Non drinker of alcohol. My hypertension must be due to genetics. I am 70 years old. I have had no side effects except the regular  migraines I have had for years have virtually disappeared. I also feel a lot calmer - in fact less anxious!! And I have even lost a couple of pounds! My blood pressure average used to be 151/88. Now, eight weeks later it is 131/83. I think it has taken a few weeks to work to its full effect. I am so pleased. I wanted an ARB medication rather than risk starting on a Calcium Channel Blocker with all its well known side effects especially swollen ankles and puffiness. I do feel for those of you where this medication has not worked - it is really worrying trying to reduce your blood pressure. I guess it's a matter of working with your doctor and trying different types of medications to see what works best. Good luck.”","

Started on half a pill 12.5 mg of Losartan and 15 mg of HCL.  Foot pain dissipated but insomnia remained.

I didn't take the pills last night and the nausea is gradually easing.  I'm not taking my morning dose either.  My bp this morning is 139/91.  It hasn't helped much because it's been around there since I started losartan.  I will be asking for a beta blocker, which, when I've been on it before, never caused me any problems.

Have lost some excess weight, crave protein and have to eat frequently otherwise I get hypoglycemic very quickly. My ribs are a little sore and I get stitches quite often, but it's a minor annoyance compared to how Lisinopril made me feel. No cough or swelling here, which seem to be common side effects.

I am allergic to sufla and iodine, lots of drugs have this in their inactive ingredients. I was taking nadolol for 8 years  with no side effects but sandoz stopped making it. They didn’t have anything back in the inactive ingredients they said they stopped it cause commercial reasons so now I had to try these horrible pills .

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on losartan for 2 years now, to begin with 25mg then 50mg and shortly after 100mg. The lower dose caused no side effects but as soon as it was increased I started to become lethargic and depressive. My thighs, knees and back ached to the point where it was difficult to walk on occasions. There was no great improvement in my BP with the higher dose so I reduced the dose to 50mg by cutting the 100mg tablets in two and there has been an improvement in the symptoms but it's not perfect. Back to the doctor I guess.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Getting two blood pressure readings of 180/90 a year apart worried me so I asked a physician  to prescribe something.  This is what I got (50 mg.)

I forget to take it about twice a week.  My last reading was 150/90, but I had skipped my dose that morning.  

I occasionally have hip, knee, and ankle pains, diarrhea, and disturbed sleep with vivid dreams, but no more than I did before starting Losartan.

Improvements I noticed:  I have more energy, for sure.  My arms don't feel ""tight"" inside on days when I remember to take it.

The only negative thing that is different is I sometimes get the feeling I'm losing my mind, in a way I never felt before taking this.  I can get the feelings under control in a short time, though.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I am a 53 year old woman who was prescribed Losartan for chronic high blood pressure (150/100 average). At first it did not seem to be helping, but knowing it takes time to work, I kept at it. Lo and behold, after 3 months I started registering better BP at my frequent doctor appointments, and they continued to improve. But...there's always a big but, right? I am having increasing issues with clogged sinuses every evening after taking it. I have never had allergies in life, but it feels like I do within 30 minutes after taking it. I use an Automatic Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) for severe Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the swelling in my sinuses turns me into a mouth breather - once I can get to sleep.

Rather take lisinopril and deal with cough until I see my new doctor on Friday.  Think it also makes me tired and constipated, nauseous, and no appetite.

They did all precautionary testing, good news my heart was fine. But I explained I had a cough form the BP I was on so the switched me to 25mg Losarten, things got worse. Been to a Rheumatologist, ENT and GI specialist and back in the ER. After extensive bloodwork, X-rays Ultrasounds CT scans, medications that I probably don't need. I am finally convinced it is the Losartan. Which has caused Acid Reflux, high liver enzymes and recently diagnosis with non alcoholic fatty liver. I have started to wean myself off them.

I'm 42. 5,2"" tall and currently weigh is  133lbd....almost 10 more than last year. I have a physically demanding job and I'm on my feet all day. I excercise 3-4 days a week. Zumba and sculpting class. For awhile I was running around 3-4 miles a day. I eat very healthy. All meals are home cooked and I eat clean.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Did nothing to lower my blood pressure, and I am quite certain caused chronic pleural effusions which required going on 4 thoracentesis procedures.  This is a condition where the pleural space around the lung, which already has fluid to help the lung glide easily in the chest, increases it's fluid to, well for me, TWO LITERS, on one side, and yesterday, 1.1 liters on the other.  I can time my lung issues directly to the initiation of Losartan.  I believe it altered the hydro-dynamics of my body , a common theme from Losartan users.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking Losartan 100mg due to the Valsartan recall on 12/3/18.  I've had none of the stated side effects but my blood sugar numbers have gone up significantly after a month on the drug. I'm trying everything to lower it, added more exercise classes (6 days a week), lowered my alcohol consumption to 2 oz of red wine no more than 3 days a week, staying away from bread, rice, pasta, and not eating past 7pm.  My readings are in the 200's each morning.  Nothing I read states that Losartan causes a spike in blood sugar levels.  Has anyone experienced this?

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I reviewed this drug 2 yrs ago after switching from Lisinopril because of intestinal angioedema. It reoccured for me with Losartan out if the blue after two years on this medicine. Did some digging and apparently it's fairly common if you've experienced it on Lisinopril to have it with losartan too. Bummer. It worked well for controlling my bp and helped me fall asleep quickly because I took it before bed. If you experience horrible abdominal pain on an ACE or ARB, could be intestinal angioedema. FYI”","

My heart was doing well for about 6 months after this, but then it happened again a few more times.  This last time, July 2016, I went to the ER and they found I had a 2nd Degree Heart Block Mobitz Type ll with Bradycardia.

Suddenly my  blood pressure (BP) started hitting 160/100. My MD suggested adding Losartan 25 mg with no effect but huge side effects like headache, joint pain , sleepless nights. My MD refused to accept side effects could be due to Lasartan. She upped the dose to 50 mg with no effect. However my side effects increased. Had severe chills, sleepless nights and fatigue.

Often with blood as I damaged my throat since switching to 50mg Losartan I have lost the cough and feel fine. As much as my other conditions are allowing me to be. I am 49 and have severe asthma and due to an accident chronic long term pain. So have not noticed any back pain but I think Losartan works really well for me and if they ever need to increase the dose we are going to monitor for any side effects (this was my gp's advice not mine) I have.

Then, I was experiencing major depression off and on for months, nausea, extreme sensitivity to sound that I would startle easy, along with failing memory/concentration as my memory before the Losartan was pretty sharp.  I also found out during that 12 month period that I now have big gallstones and diverticulosis. 
These symptoms didn't appear until AFTER I started taking the Losartan daily for 12 months. Now, the Losartan is not working on my BP, so my doctor wants to try another medication on me, with of course more side effects. Not recommended.”","

Nothing has worked,  beta blockers made my heart race and caused severe GERD.  Amlodipine gave me palpitations,  lisinopril made me cough, HCTZ caused severe dizziness and high heart rate.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Everyone's physiology reacts uniquely.  Calcium channel blockers cause my ankles to swell.  One beta blocker didn't work; another worked for 10 years before stopping.  Alpha blockers gave me orthostatic hypotension.  The perfect combination seemed to be an ace inhibitor and a diuretic, but the diuretic gives me dangerously high uric acid. It lowers fluid volume and decreases the kidney's ability to excrete uric acid. Losartan is the only BP medication that lowers uric acid, so I was switched to losartan with a small dose of HCTZ.  Working well so far.”","

Family history of heart and BP problems and now in my mid-40s so saw a cardiologist. Had a full check up, heart is fine - which is a relief. Put on 25mg of Lorsartan - which from what I read is half the recommended starting dose - so I can't see how it could be a placebo effect. But I saw an immediate difference. Highest since is 133/92. Averaging out at 126/82 with a pulse of 82. Nothing else has changed (apart from the knowledge now that my heart is fine, which may have an effect).

I have experienced insomnia once in a while, but I changed the time of day I take Losartan. I take it early morning. It seemed to help. Of course everyone is different with different sensitivities.

Dose 2 ~ I still seem to have some trouble concentrating (like brain fog) plus I am feeling nauseous and a bit light headed.

Started in May 2021 Here we are 8 /3/ 2021
I have gone to the Hospital 4 times for Screaming Blood pressure 
Heart palpitations so strong that I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.
 at bedtime and the palpitations start , swelling in the deep tissue in my legs and throat and neck… feels like someone’s mildly choking me .
Then the excessive frequent urination at night and being barely able to hold back during the day is overwhelming .
Doctors say they haven’t heard of these side effects and now I’m presenting forum posts from other patients. Big concerns for me is will it actually level out?
I have seen my pressure actually increase and become almost unmanageable.
Like the drug formulation is inconsistent?
I once took three 50mg tablets in a day and when I left the hospital I was still 170/110.
My daily prescription is 50 mg.

I am really convinced that the cause of all my symptoms is Losartan & have told my GP this more than once. After reading other peoples experiences am now going to push for coming off these terrible pills.”",1
Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“Works well with minimal side effects for the most part however I had to switch pharmacies and manufacturer of Losartan to eliminate the back cramps which are the most common side effect. BP stays at 115/70 now on 25mg. On lowest dosage as diet change had a huge impact.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“Brutal medicine this is the third and worse by far I’ve tried. Side effects I hit are exhaustion can’t stay awake past 9pm and dizziness in the morning. Major pain and tightness in my knees to a point it affected my walking. Took me 10-15 minutes to get out of bed in the morning. It took 2-3 weeks of taking Losartan to start feeling it so it can be deceiving. I’ll take the HBP over the pain.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I started taking Losartan 100 MG over a month ago due to Volsartan recall. Not pleased with it at all. Tiredness, diarrhea,  moodiness, headaches, body pain, nausea, heartburn and lightheaded. Dr. Added 25 MG HCTZ that really wreaked havoc. Ended up in dr office and urgent clinic 3 times in a week. May look into another class of BP med. Dr said the other classes have more side effects though. Especially Beta Blockers.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Went down with vertigo 11 months ago. Finally diagnosed a minor stroke causing vestibular neuritis. The treatment has been to try and  lower BP so that minor arteries feeding the  inner ear relax to get balance back. I was not quite hyper when tested by GP but well over when tested over 24 hours. First drug tried was Amlopidine (10mg) which did lower BP to 135/85. However this gave side effects (swollen ankles, breathlessness, poor sleep. The next was Riparin (2.5 mg) also gave side effects (dry cough, lack of energy, breathlessness). I am now on Losartan 50mg (for 5 days now) and again find some side effects, breathlessness, tiredness - not reduced BP which is (140/100). Needs to be increased but hopefully side effects will wear off?”",1
Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Started on Losartan 100 almost a month ago. Nausea & insomnia followed immediately. Now I have a rash on my breast. Don’t know if it’s connected. As for bp it lowered it to the 130s over high 80s.
I have to take something to sleep or I am up at 3 nightly. Just awful.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Foggy/ blurred vision/ vertigo/ itchy skin/ muscle aches/ swollen ankles w/ kidney pain/ when on 50mg four times daily....much better when switched to 25 mg twice daily



Bad Hives/ with Solco Labs/25mg bid....off now. 

The unfortunate issue is when you have to change pharmacies due to insurances you have, and the labs that make the drug aren't available at the new pharmacy. Different issues can pop up due to ingredient differences/different makers. This is what I have had to work with as well as adjusting dosage to alleviate side effects.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been on Losartan 25mg for about 3 months now for slightly high bp, 155/93 or thereabouts. I am a 62 yo female who was working full time. The drug works fine for me, no dizziness or nausea. However, I have began to notice some joint pain in my right elbow and left wrist which may or may not be related to the drug. It's just that I didn't have it before. I did have a but with left side back ache for 3 days that I thought was kidney, but there were no other symptoms of kidney issues so just hit water bottled it and it went away. No issues other than the sore joints. Not taking any other meds so no interactions.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“This medicine was horrible for me.  At first, I was on one by a manufacturer that had it in little green oval pills.  I did have anxiety and never wanted my sister to leave me after I took the pill.  However, I felt fairly normal (although, not completely).   The pharmacy switched manufactuers and they were then little white pills that looked almost like aspirin.  The anxiety got terrible then.  I had the strong feeling of buzzing from inside my head to all the way around it.  I wanted my sister to stay with me ALL THE TIME.   I didn't even want her to leave for ONE MINUTE.   I was lucky if I could handle going to the bathroom alone.   I HATED being alone.   I don't like being alone as it is, but I can usually handle being alone for an hour”","

Lots of dizziness, constipation and malaise, combined with tingling in extremities; subsequently cut HCTZ to 12,5mg.  BP sits at roughly 100/60-110/70 with regular daily exercise and dietary changes.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I recently took Losartan for 10 days. Within an hour of taking the first dose I had a huge dizzy spell, became very nauseous and shaky and my balance was way off. I drove straight home barely able to walk. I stayed on the drug for 10 days because I was told ""you have to get used to it"". I didn't leave my house for the 10 days because it was too dangerous with those symptoms. I normally exercise and walk daily and have part time jobs. Couldn't go to anything. After 1 day of stopping it I am getting better, slowly.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I'm hoping this will help others looking into Losartan after reading the reviews. I've had a great experience with it. I've had mild hypertension for about a year and was reluctant to take anything due to always being sensitive to meds. My dr started me on 25 mg and it has my BP back to normal range. I've had migraines for years and it has actually reduced my chronic headaches and has helped me sleep. I take mine in the morning. If I take it at night it seems to make me not sleep as well. My father is on it as well and has had no side effects. Everyone is different of course but hope this helps.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Soon after starting Losartan I began experiencing pain in both feet, I thought it was plantar fasciitis but eventually I began experiencing pain in my legs as well. My muscle completely locked up and nerve pain, numbness, tingling and also a rash like appearance on my lower legs. I was told repeatedly that it was not the Losartan, I stopped taking it and amazingly I started to improve. It's been three weeks off and while not completely improved I feel so much better!”",1

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I was prescribed this more than 20 years ago, but other issues caused them to switch to HCTZ, medrol, lisinopril (coughed and they took me off), and eventually back to Cozaar.  I didn't realize it at the time, but looking back over the data, I see that whenever my dose was above 50mg (it's been 75 and 100 at times), my weight shot up a good bit.  Couple that with an SSRI (sometimes taken in concert with >50mg Cozaar, sometimes not taken at all) and you get dramatic ballooning.  I'm now trying to get weight down and that's lowering BP so when I get down to 25mg, we'll see if weight comes off faster.”","
6 "
Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I was put on Losartan because of the bad side effects from Valsartan (gout).  My main concern is Losartan's side effects of fatigue when you are trying to do anything physical and brain fog where at times your memory clarity is affected. Simple words just seem to not be there when talking where I had a clear mind before taking Losartan. The mental aspect is really hard to handle.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“So, I've been on Losartan for about 16 days now. I Also try to tell my PCP, ""Listen, I've been experiencing side effects like the dizzy spells, low energy, muscle pains & cramps, headaches, lightheaded"" Oh well they just brushed it off.

It is funny they always mention anxiety in the PCP office as well and they referred me to an Office to discuss what an how to approach it. As I didn't have any Anxiety UNTIL I quit smoking about 3 months ago as well.

Anywho, I'm thankful for seeing all of these post before anything drastic happens to me other symptoms wise and will be speaking to my PCP on Monday about coming in to wean off Losartan, As they told me I have a ""Elevated BP and prescribed this Losartan right away"" Was 140|80 sometimes in the 130s|80s”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,“I have been taking losartan since 1999. I went to the doctor for routine visit. I was going through a divorce and learning a new job. My BP was 200 plus over 100 plus. I had no idea it could get that high without causing a stroke.  My doctor put me on 100/25MG. The only complaint I have is urinating quite often. I will take my medication since I don't want to have a stroke. There are many BP medicines out there but this is the only one I have ever taken.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I have been using losartan 25mg for over 10 years. I was switched from lisinopril because it caused me to cough too much. Losartan has kept my BP down to pretty much normal levels. Possible side effects (first two of which I doubt are Losartan caused) are hair loss, frequent urination and diarrhea. First one could just be natural/hereditary. All the men in my family have or had thinned hair as they got old. Second one could be reduced kidney function due to being pre-diabetic which was undiagnosed for years. The last one, diarrhea is one I think is most likely to be an actual side effect. Though I would prefer to just call it soft/watery stools. I don't go any more often than I did before Losartan. I will bring it up at my next Doctor visit though. Overall a great medication for blood pressure.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone. This was prescribed for hypertension. I took it for a while and noticed some coughing, but thought I was managing okay. I gradually noticed increased pain which I did not immediately recognize as a side effect of the losartan. I eventually did a couple trials by stopping this medicine for some weeks and then restarting. My pain was definitely much worse with losartan. I later researched this and found studies showed losartan to cause or worsen pain. No thanks! Thank goodness I recognized the awful pain was a side effect. Yikes! 
I take verapamil IR now and feel so much better. It has anti inflammatory properties, reduces the pain in my body, reduces headaches, and helps the BP. Verapamil wins for me.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“After taking Losartan 50mg.I observed I have recurring hacking cough, and its worst at night before going to bed.  I had x ray, and all is normal.

The things I have noticed most is probably one half hour after taking it, I notice that my heart will skip a beat but only very occasionally. In addition, the other thing I've noticed is I seem to get this tightness across my abdominal muscle right below the rib cage especially if I sit forward. It's not at all painful, it's just that I'm aware of it more. It lowers my pressure to ranging within 127/82 to 140/95. I think that depends on what I eat that makes it fluctuate like this.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“51 year old male, active by riding bicycles, regular fitness and moderate weigh lifting. Overweight due to muscle mass. 
I was diagnosed with HBP after recovering from Covid infection with mild symptoms. My blood pressure was in the 135-145 to 80-90 range at the time I was diagnosed.  
After taking 25mg Losartan my BP would consistently measure 160/90. 
My doctor increased dose to 50mg daily and my BP went to 170/95. 
I take myself off Losartan and BP goes back to original levels. I restart Losartan BP goes up. It's very consistent. 
Other mild side effects are blurry vision, fatigue, light dizziness. I would be willing to deal with these if it actually lowered my BP. 
I think this medication is very dangerous and will probably end up in a class action lawsuit.”","

I hope this medicine will eventually get my pressure back down to normal range with in a couple of weeks but is being closely monitored by my doctor.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I'm physically fit however stress has raised my BP.  I'm approaching 50.  So far so good- day three, I have been calm when facing stressful situations.  My BP seems to range around but it will take two weeks to see how this effects me.  No fatigue symptoms.  No stomach cramps, normal bowel movements.  Did have some light dizziness but it's gone now.  (keep in mind you need to exercise) this stuff is supposed to lower your BP if your feeling fatigue.)”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I read many of the reviews .  I take 50 mg dose and  it works well for my blood pressure .  I’ve been taking it about 2 years .  The one issue I have is it doesn’t work well over a 24 hour period.  I’ve taken several BP meds,  they all may lower your pressure - it’s the side effects to watch out for .  In my case this has minimal to no side effects  that I’ve noticed but everyone is different .  Diet , exercise and relaxing techniques help tremendously Good luck everyone .”","

Losartan,Cozaar (losartan) for High Blood Pressure:,“My MD put me on Cozaar for my hypertension and rapid pulse. I also take Verapamil. I have a condition called Marfan's Syndrome and Doctor hopes this medicine will help prevent any further dilation of my aorta. I had to go off the hydrochlorothiazide and now have a lot of edema in my legs to above my knees so started on Lasix today also. But it's worth using in order to protect my blood vessels.”,"

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“On Losartan 25mg for 3 yrs, after heart attack. Just discovered  side effects are related to Med. At first Losartan dropped BP extremely low & couldn’t stay awake or function. Reduced dose from daily to every other day. After a year, developed a chronic dry cough. At same time, developed an adverse reaction, called Interstitial Granulomatous Dermatitis, which is a rare skin disorder. I’ve had both cough & IGD for 2 yrs, happening  simultaneously. Changing my med to see if both clear up. Other side effects are heart palpitations, extreme anxiety, depression, dizziness, leg muscle weakness, joint pain, achey shoulder blades, arms & hands, numbness and tingling in hands/feet, headaches, fatigue, sudden weight gain, abdominal pain, hair loss, acid reflux.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Slightly overweight male in mid to late 30s, and fairly active.  Had a blood pressure 150 something over 90 something.  I used Lisinopril for a while but the constant coughing became too much.  I asked my doc for an ARB and was moved to Losartan 50 mg.  It is a little harder to fall asleep on it.  I did also notice some skipped beat/palpitation stuff in the first few weeks, but I get this with stress and too much caffeine anyway.  About 3 weeks in the palpitations were gone, or at least unnoticeable.  The only atypical side effect I have noticed is irritability.  It's not severe, I just find myself a little less patient and I get flustered or defensive more easily than usual.  No side effect is severe enough for me to consider discontinuing use.  Current BP is mid-130s over mid-80s, I'm going to try and pull it a little lower with diet and exercise, but am otherwise happy with the reduction on the drug.”","

Stuck with this for another 5 weeks, experiencing feelings of shortness of breath, tremors, terror and panic, doom and gloom. Glad I came on here to read similar reviews.

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Started taking Losartan, 20mg about a year ago.  No side effects, but my BP was not going down, hovering around 146/85.  Cardiologist raised dosage to 100mg.  After two months I experienced severe vertigo, lightheadedness, weakness in legs and arms, nausea.  Went to GP and he thought it might be meniere's disease, but that was ruled out by my ENT who thought it might be an inner ear viral infection.  Nothing they gave me worked until I saw the side effects of Losartan.  Stopped taking it and symptoms started easing up within a few days.  Still experiencing days of lightheadedness, but it is gradually getting better.  Cardiologist took me off all BP meds and BP has remained around 130/82 for three weeks.  More tests with a neurologist if symptom continue.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“Was on Lisinopril for many years until I developed allergies.   Losartan has the least side effects of most ACE and ARB's but is the least potent.   Most people complain about insomnia from any ARB and this was true for me.  I found that if I go above 50 mg of Losartan I will experience insomnia and restlessness.  Currently taking only 50 mg but this does not always control the seasonal spikes in the 150 / 95.  Most of the time my BP averages  130 / 80, however.”",1

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I've been on Losartan since April 2019.  Previous to that I was on Lisinopril for 3 months.   The Lisinopril made me feel very ill both physically and mentally and made my BP increase.  As a 43 year old male I had dangerously high BP occasionally peaking at 200/110.  I'm on 100mg per day of Losartan and 10mg of Amlodipine.  These have been fantastic in bringing my BP down to safe and normal levels, however I've always had a slight fuzziness or fogginess in my head.  It's a feeling like I'm not 100% alert.   Recently this has gotten worse and I'm having periods of feeling dizzy, vertigo feelings and focusing issues.  Often feel like my eyes are straining and my forehead and scalp feel tight.  I've also noticed I don't take in information so well.  Not so much memory loss, more like a foggy and lazy brain.  It's only after doing some research and seeing sites like this that I realize I'm not crazy and the BP drugs are the most likely candidate.”","

Losartan,For High Blood Pressure:,"“I went yesterday to the doctor and he found my blood pressure to be 200-80. He recommended to begin immediately with half a pill of 25 mg losartan. I took my blood pressure 2 hours after the first dose and found 150-80
I took the second dose of 12.5 mg after 12 hours and measured my pressure after 24 hours and I got result of 120-60,
I believe that I was stressed and anxious when I visited the doctor and that was the reason for momentaneous high blood pressure. I am going to interrupt the treatment and check my blood  pressures next week, in case that  I get into a situation of high stress and anxiety with my blood pressure going above 200. I will take the minimum dose 12.5 mg until it comes down to normal. It might be enough with a couple of doses like today.
My question is if this is correct or the withdrawal might carry side effects. Thanks so much for an expert’s answer”","

I asked him why the Losartan was not controlling my blood pressure at his office, and he said I had too much anxiety, and that blood pressure medicine would not control that, well I wanted on blood pressure medicine to control my white coat syndrome, so that didn't make sense. About a month later I stated having severe anxiety attacks, dizziness, foggy headed, almost could not function I read all of the reviews on here, and discovered it probably was the medicine.

I had pretty bad nausea after both doses. I am taking 40 mg once a day. I had to call in sick today as the nausea was causing vomiting. I'll try taking it after work. I went back to bed after calling in sick today and my cat that always sleeps on me was quite annoyed at trips to the bathroom every 10 minutes.”","

One those days where I am seriously retaining fluids and feeling bloated, my doc told me to take a double dose instead and my calves and feet go from looking like engorged balloons to slim with the veins popping out. I have CHF and when I retain fluids, it becomes hard to breathe, so my Lasix is a lifesaver.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“I have a genetic condition called Venous Insufficiency, which doesn't allow the blood & fluid to be returned from my lower legs & feet, so they swell and the skin can start to break down, which opens up the opportunity for infection.  Have been taking Furosemide 40mg 1x day for over a year now - it is the only thing that keeps me from being in the hospital all the time with infections that require IV antibiotics. The only side effects I've noticed are the very frequent urination (not really a side effect, it's what the drug is *supposed* to do, as it flushes fluids out of the body), and aching in my legs and feet as the fluid leaves - I can only assume that is caused by my body trying to push the fluid out.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“I was prescribed the generic form of Lasix a few days ago for severe peripheral edema. The doctor had me taking 20 mg twice a day for three days and now I'm taking 20 mg. So far, I have notice only a subtle difference/improvement in the major swelling of my feet, ankles, legs and abdomen. I am experiencing an increase in frequency of urination, as others have described, but it doesn't seem like I 'm voiding enough, which may be why I am still so swollen. It has been only four days on Lasix and I am in terrible pain. Hopefully, the swelling will subside or at least decrease, otherwise, I will be contacting the MD for advice. I have also experienced headaches daily since I began the medication. I have been extremely dizzy as well.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“I was put on the med and I became extremely confused  (couldn't even remember what house I lived in) and I was at home.  So weak I could hardly get out of  bed. 3 weeks later I was changed to hydrochlorathiazide  for 2 weeks with the same effect, just not quite so severe .  I quit all this type of med and within 24 hours I could tell a difference.
I even did some grocery shopping today. The first time in 6 weeks I was exhausted to say the least but  at least I was able to do it. No I didn't carry them in , nor have to them put away. But I was able to do it. I can't wait to see the progress tomorrow.
So in conclusion BE CAREFUL”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“My cardiologist put me on Lasix over a month ago due to edema of the legs and ankles. My rate of urination was about every 45 minutes nowhere as bad as some of the reviewers. I refilled my prescription and noticed an immediate change. Instead of every 45 minutes, it changed to every hour and a half. The only difference is the manufacturer.  The Lasix made by Sandoz seems to work fine. ”","

My bp was 155/96 after I took the meds, first day worked very well. I went to the bathroom 4 times really well. Then within one day I noticed I lost 7 pounds! But after you take it awhile you'll notice you won't pee as much, and weight loss will be slower. But it does work just remember to take potassium pills, and eat foods with potassium like bananas. Also eat a low sodium diet!!! :)”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“Dr. has me back on lasix again for edema and will try another round.  The first round was 20mg. X 2 for 6mo.s (damn I was patient) for the swelling in my feet.  I was weeing a lot but it didn't hardly reduce the swelling.  I've also noticed a significant increase in the cravings for potassium laden food so I believe it HAS drained me of that!
Will try to get Doc to increase it to 40mg all at once as other reviewers have stated that 20mg is not enough... and it sure hasn't been for me.”","

I take 80 mg in the morning.  It does not always take all the swelling out, but if I miss just one dose, I can tell it by the afternoon.  Of course, if I take it in the afternoon, I'm up all night.  NOTE: There IS a difference in taking the Lasix as opposed to the generic furosemide.  For me, the generic is absolutely useless.  My mother had the same problem, so maybe it's genetic.  I've taken as much as 200 mg of generic at one time with no effect whatsoever.  I've noticed no side effects from the Lasix.”","

Furosemide,For Edema:,"“Furosemide is a drug that needs better regulation. Only Mylan brand is effective, all other generics have zero results for me, as if they are fake, not containing any actual medicine. This is a life threatening problem for people who need a diuretic, one that the FDA should have addressed years ago, bad generics.”",1
Furosemide,For Edema:,"“I have had edema before in primarily my left leg, however, it usually goes away on it own.  After some yard work in the heat, I was quite swollen in especially the left leg and as the leg went down, a heaviness settled in my chest and I could barely breath. I was taken to the ER after I started fearing a heart condition and was found to have heart failure with a normal functioning heart.  I was given furosemide by vein in ER and was admitted.  I was sent home after testing with a script for two 40mg twice a day and feel much better.  I still feel really tired after very little exertion and have had some cramps in my feet. Overall, I feel much, I hope that after losing some weight, I will be back to normal very soon. This is a wake up call.”","

In the hospital they put Lasix in IV & it works almost immediately causing me to urinate about 20 times.  My doctor has me on 40 mg of Lasix & low salt diet.  The swelling has left my legs, but not my feet.  I have noticed that if I elevate my feet at least 3-4 times a day with feet at heart level, the swelling goes down much better.  I am trusting that swelling will go away completely soon.  I am doing much better since going to emergency room, just still having difficulty walking.  This can be very stressful to deal with because it affects mobility & exercising is challenging. I am a fall risk.”","

Furosemide,For Edema:,"“I was fine on furosemide for a year before it stopped working well. They upped the dose. Worked a little, then stopped again. They put me on a rescue diuretic. Metolazone spiked my creatinine, so they took that away but never changed my Lasix. Finally I was left with the choice of an ER visit or a sauna at my gym. That started a months-long period where I was taking 4 to 8 pounds of water off in the sauna every day to deal with my crappy response to Lasix. And that was sending my blood pressure down into 70's/40's. My cardiologist then referred me to a transplant team, who switched me to bumetanide on the first visit and told me to quit the sauna. Thanks to having a diuretic that actually works though, I don't need the sauna. Lasix is well known for becoming ineffective, and cardiologists are well known to let you suffer for MONTHS and even visits to the ER without changing it out for something that works. Don't let them do this to you. DEMAND a switch and don't give them an option.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“I was put on the med and I became extremely confused  (couldn't even remember what house I lived in) and I was at home.  So weak I could hardly get out of  bed. 3 weeks later I was changed to hydrochlorathiazide  for 2 weeks with the same effect, just not quite so severe .  I quit all this type of med and within 24 hours I could tell a difference.
I even did some grocery shopping today. The first time in 6 weeks I was exhausted to say the least but  at least I was able to do it. No I didn't carry them in , nor have to them put away. But I was able to do it. I can't wait to see the progress tomorrow.
So in conclusion BE CAREFUL”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“My cardiologist put me on Lasix over a month ago due to edema of the legs and ankles. My rate of urination was about every 45 minutes nowhere as bad as some of the reviewers. I refilled my prescription and noticed an immediate change. Instead of every 45 minutes, it changed to every hour and a half. The only difference is the manufacturer.  The Lasix made by Sandoz seems to work fine. ”","

My bp was 155/96 after I took the meds, first day worked very well. I went to the bathroom 4 times really well. Then within one day I noticed I lost 7 pounds! But after you take it awhile you'll notice you won't pee as much, and weight loss will be slower. But it does work just remember to take potassium pills, and eat foods with potassium like bananas. Also eat a low sodium diet!!! :)”","

X 2 for 6mo.s (damn I was patient) for the swelling in my feet.  I was weeing a lot but it didn't hardly reduce the swelling.  I've also noticed a significant increase in the cravings for potassium laden food so I believe it HAS drained me of that!
Will try to get Doc to increase it to 40mg all at once as other reviewers have stated that 20mg is not enough... and it sure hasn't been for me.”","

I take 80 mg in the morning.  It does not always take all the swelling out, but if I miss just one dose, I can tell it by the afternoon.  Of course, if I take it in the afternoon, I'm up all night.  NOTE: There IS a difference in taking the Lasix as opposed to the generic furosemide.  For me, the generic is absolutely useless.  My mother had the same problem, so maybe it's genetic.  I've taken as much as 200 mg of generic at one time with no effect whatsoever.  I've noticed no side effects from the Lasix.”","

Furosemide,For Edema:,"“Furosemide is a drug that needs better regulation. Only Mylan brand is effective, all other generics have zero results for me, as if they are fake, not containing any actual medicine. This is a life threatening problem for people who need a diuretic, one that the FDA should have addressed years ago, bad generics.”",1
Furosemide,For Edema:,"“I have had edema before in primarily my left leg, however, it usually goes away on it own.  After some yard work in the heat, I was quite swollen in especially the left leg and as the leg went down, a heaviness settled in my chest and I could barely breath. I was taken to the ER after I started fearing a heart condition and was found to have heart failure with a normal functioning heart.  I was given furosemide by vein in ER and was admitted.  I was sent home after testing with a script for two 40mg twice a day and feel much better.  I still feel really tired after very little exertion and have had some cramps in my feet. Overall, I feel much, I hope that after losing some weight, I will be back to normal very soon. This is a wake up call.”","

In the hospital they put Lasix in IV & it works almost immediately causing me to urinate about 20 times.  My doctor has me on 40 mg of Lasix & low salt diet.  The swelling has left my legs, but not my feet.  I have noticed that if I elevate my feet at least 3-4 times a day with feet at heart level, the swelling goes down much better.  I am trusting that swelling will go away completely soon.  I am doing much better since going to emergency room, just still having difficulty walking.  This can be very stressful to deal with because it affects mobility & exercising is challenging. I am a fall risk.”","

Furosemide,For Edema:,"“I was fine on furosemide for a year before it stopped working well. They upped the dose. Worked a little, then stopped again. They put me on a rescue diuretic. Metolazone spiked my creatinine, so they took that away but never changed my Lasix. Finally I was left with the choice of an ER visit or a sauna at my gym. That started a months-long period where I was taking 4 to 8 pounds of water off in the sauna every day to deal with my crappy response to Lasix. And that was sending my blood pressure down into 70's/40's. My cardiologist then referred me to a transplant team, who switched me to bumetanide on the first visit and told me to quit the sauna. Thanks to having a diuretic that actually works though, I don't need the sauna. Lasix is well known for becoming ineffective, and cardiologists are well known to let you suffer for MONTHS and even visits to the ER without changing it out for something that works. Don't let them do this to you. DEMAND a switch and don't give them an option.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“It's very important to read the side effects of all the medicines that your Doctor prescribes to you. Sometimes the side effects are a bigger problem then the original problem you were trying to treat.

First time I used lasix was in the emergency room they gave me a huge shot of it and when I left there three hours later my ankles and feet were totally back to normal!

But when one day you are swollen as a balloon and about 2 to 3 days later your are unswollen.  I first started out on 10 mg as needed, then had to go up to 20mg when required, then daily. Then eventually kept raising it by 20 after that to 40mg daily. Then I ended up having to take 2 x 40 mg daily, 2 x a day.

My legs were rock hard in the evenings, severe pitting, skin on fire and full of a tingling, rushing feeling. None of that tonight, but edema and pitting are still present.

Then I saw a nephrologist who said I needed furosemide instead of HCTZ.  I started taking 20mg/day and the swelling began coming back.  The doc said give it some time, you probably ate a salty meal or something.  Well the edema really never did completely go away again.  I had a kidney biopsy and then was put on Prednisone 60 mg/day and swelling really got bad, gained about 25 pounds water.  Doc bumped me up to 40mg/day furosemide and it still didn't work.

I was taking 80 mg twice a day and at times could not urinate at all. After retaining 100 extra lbs. of fluid in a 6 wks span, I was forced to go to the ER.

At first, this helped a little bit, but when you have 158/90 BP, you need more than 5% reduction in it. This medication made me severely dehydrated and caused significant electrolyte loss. I quit it and tried Chlorthalidone, but that again failed - if you only have mild elevated BP, this could be OK; if you have significant hypertension, though, you are much better suited to a real medication, such as a beta blocker.”","

After just one day taking furosemide there was almost no edema at all - and that was on just 40 mg.

Furosemide,For Hypercalcemia:,"“Furosemide acts quickly and consistently. My only input is that you would do well to watch your potassium intake  since this medication dumps electrolytes at the loop of henle, in the kidneys. Eat your bananas, oranges and potatoes. ALWAYS let your doctor know you take it. My son was given an antibiotic, that also lowered potassium, and the allergist kept insisting that the baby did NOT take Lasix, that was for old people. I had to show him the bottle for him to believe that I had not mixed up medication names. Anyway, my son had to have a potassium supplement due to the medicine regime. This could have been dangerous for my son, hence my warning.”","

My cardiologist started me on 40 mgs of Lasix once a day, than 20 mgs, and I'm presently on 40 mgs twice daily.  In the past, I have been on the VENTILATOR 3 times due to fluid retention around my heart and in my lungs. I can say without a doubt that my ""miracle drug"" Lasix, is one of the reasons I was able to survive for close to 20 years with CHF.  Pray for a CHF cure. God Bless Everyone.”","

Furosemide,Lasix (furosemide) for Edema:,"“On 1/30/22, I woke up with ankle & foot swelling & pain out of nowhere. I thought it may have been connected to a full body massage I'd gotten 2 days before that but, at this point, it seems it's not. I'm still having this issue 3.5 weeks later, but now the edema is pitting.  I saw my Dr 2 days ago & she pointed out that my calves are also swollen. She prescribed this med for me to take twice a day for three days. She's also sending me for an echocardiogram. So far, I've taken one dose & it maybe the last one I take. I've got the absolute worst optical/sinus headache. I've taken my rx migraine med, rx ibuprofen & 2 OTC sinus pills with no luck. I'm aware headaches are a possible side effect but I didn't expect it to be this bad. As expected, I'm peeing a lot, but the negatives are outweighing the positives.”","
