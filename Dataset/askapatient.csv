Bad drug. |||||| LONGER VERSION:
I am 28 years old, 5'10 & 190 lbs., fairly athletic/active, have type 1 diabetes but am otherwise healthy, don't drink/drug recreationally and almost never have bad med reactions.
I take a low dose of methadone in the early am (~5:00) & occasional 5mg zolpidem for sleep; no OTC's besides occasional APAP & Tums. I have never once had a reaction, interaction, or uncomfortable/undesirable experience with any of them, mixed or alone.
Was prescribed this for a minor bp jump; doc said she picked this cause it's well-known, safe & unlikely to cause a reaction/interaction (I strongly disagree).
****************MY EXPERIENCE*******************: Took *one time* (late afternoon) and within ~20 mins it began...Dizziness, trouble keeping my balance, mod-severe anxiety, nausea & sharp abdominal pain/cramping, and perceived shortness of breath (sensation; no actual breathing difficulty).
This has persisted into the next day & I have not re-dosed (nor will I).
I had/am having other symptoms that I've omitted because while I assume they are related, it's possible to attribute them to something else: sore throat, random aches & pains, and others.

I am so distressed. I've cried and cried over the loss of my hair and now to find out that it is linked to my blood pressure medication?! This isn't fair. I don't even want to go out in public any more! Why do they not tell you these things? I do not mean to sound vain, but my hair was my pride and glory. Most women know what I mean.

If any of you know anyone who is taking a blood pressure drug like an ACE inhibitor, please warn them of how dangerous it is. Some people are able to tolerate it, but in my case, it was the worst thing in my life that has happened to me.\nAn ACE inhibitor is a drug that inhibits the kidneys from secreting a hormone that hardens your blood vessels. I will go into detail later, but basically that is how it works. It is actually your kidneys that control your blood pressure, and like the conspiracy that is, Lisinopril was given to me along with Metformin which is the diabetes medication to protect my kidneys from the effects of diabetes.\nAt a low dose of 10mg per day along with the Metformin, the Lisinopril worked great. It kept my blood pressure in a normal range of around 128/80 and I felt no side effects.\nOne day, I was running late for a doctor's appointment, and I didn't get a chance to take the blood pressure medication.

I wrote it off to getting old fast when only trying to work hard a couple of times a month. At age 59 I used to be able to work hard all day outside (like getting in firewood). Now at 61, I had pretty much decided I couldn't do that work anymore because about 3 months ago, I had to stop and let my heart rate slow down about every 10 minutes when cutting wood in about 80 degree heat. It took about 3 1/2 hours to do the work I normally would have easily done in an hour or so. After resting for the 1/2 hr drive home, eating something, taking a shower and laying in bed for 15 minutes, my heart rate was still 100 bpm. I then tried an experiment and tapered off the lisinopril over a two week period. It was amazing. This week I put up firewood two days in a row in high 80 degree heat and was able to work like I used to. Even though I would get winded from the exertion, at no time did my heart rate become a problem, and at no time did I get physically fatigued. All of that was clearly a lisinopril side effect.""}",Very rapid heart rate and extreme fatigue with only moderate exertion in moderate sun.,3

NORVASC,Blood Pressure,"{'Dizziness set in shortly after beginning. Specifically, it knocked out all my vestibular balance function. In other words. I had my kinetic sense and my visual sense, but I could not, for instance, stand upright with my eyes closed without falling over. I could sit on a chair or the bed or lie in bed and be okay, because my body was in substantial contact with a reliable surface or known orientation. I withdrew from the drug, which was only providing marginal improvement over my other two BO drugs that I have taken for years with untoward effects. With 48 hours, my inner ear function began returning, but erratically, resulting in frank vertigo. It\'s now been five days without, and my inner ear is somewhat normalized. I can stand with my eyes closed, for instance. I still have the ""head stuffed"" feeling that went with the dizziness, but it has lessened. I credit this wen site and everyone\'s contributions with giving me the clue. The fact that this came on shortly after taking the drug and is resolving within days of stopping it, leaves little doubt as to the cause. Drugs have side-effects. Not everyone gets them, and not everyone gets the same ones. Most have none and have a satisfactory experience. The other two drugs I take have known untoward effects, too, but I\'ve never had any of them that gave me any trouble. (I don\'t count bathroom visits at night to be an untoward effect of a diuretic. That\'s how they work.) This not a ""bad"" drug, but it does seem'}",Dizziness. Total loss of inner ear balance function. Stuffed head feeling.,2

NORVASC,High Blood Pressure,"{""I was taking a generic for Norvasc, Amlodipine. I took it for 7-8 months without noticing any side effects. Problems started with pain and stiffness in my neck muscles. A few months later I started having headaches, turned into serious migraines. I then started having blurred vision which eventually turned into double vision. It was so horrible I couldn't drive, had to bother people to come and pick me up and take me to see doctors who were totally stumped by my condition. After 4 months of awful headaches and vision issues and feeling exhausted all the time, It's as if this thing started moving down into my body. My legs became weak, all the muscles ached and my hips and knees became stiff. All the doctors had no idea what was wrong with me. After about 5 months of this nightmare, I decided to look up my medication. I was horrified but relieved to find out the reason for my condition. It was comforting to find all of the people on this blog posting their comments about the drug. It seems that prescription drugs are the last thing doctors think of when considering side effects. I stopped Amlodipine 18 days ago and it's still not completely out of my system. I didn't notice much change the first week. After that, a very gradual change, but each day gets a little bit better. The not knowing thing for so many months was scary as hell! So excited to get my life back!""}","Headaches, double vision, joint stiffness, muscles aches, weak legs and edema in my head.",1

I went to my PCP and discussed with her that the night sweats were a source of frustration for me and explained how I was concered about the above mentioned side effects that I was experiencing as possible side effects of the Norvasc.
