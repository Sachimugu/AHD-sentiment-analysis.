Losartan definitely lowers my blood pressure but there is no doubt that it causes anxiety and a feeling of fear.  It seems to amplify an emotional response to any negative thoughts and gets you to fear those questions.

I have found that changing my schedule for taking the medication also changes the schedule of the anxiety.  Ie it follows the taking of the drug by about 3 hours (which is when the drug peaks apparently).

There is no doubt that anxiety and feelings of negative well being are side effects.  So if youre having an emotional reaction (in my case 3 hours after taking) this medication may be the cause.

I still need to talk with a doctor about a new med for my hp but right now I feel better than I have in the past month. P.S. my doctor told me that this was a very safe drug and he wouldn’t put me on it if he wasn’t 100% sure.. lol, as I am stuck in China right now do to the covid-19 outbreak and can not leave the Hubei province but when I get back to America I am going to have a little talk with that dumb doc... the only thing he told me to watch out for was yellowing of the eyes and skin plus dark urine.... My advice to everyone is to stay away from Lisinopril and do your own research on the meds you take don’t just listen to some doctor just because they have “MD” in front of their names....",666,0.41774490941157605,0.12675865800865802,Poitive,0.507,Poitive

i am 28 years old, 510 & 190 lbs., fairly athletic/active, have type 1 diabetes but am otherwise healthy, dont drink/drug recreationally and almost never have bad med reactions.
i take a low dose of methadone in the early am (~5:00) & occasional 5mg zolpidem for sleep; no otcs besides occasional apap & tums. i have never once had a reaction, interaction, or uncomfortable/undesirable experience with any of them, mixed or alone.
was prescribed this for a minor bp jump; doc said she picked this cause its well-known, safe & unlikely to cause a reaction/interaction (i strongly disagree).
****************my experience*******************: took *one time* (late afternoon) and within ~20 mins it began...dizziness, trouble keeping my balance, mod-severe anxiety, nausea & sharp abdominal pain/cramping, and perceived shortness of breath (sensation; no actual breathing difficulty).
this has persisted into the next day & i have not re-dosed (nor will i).
